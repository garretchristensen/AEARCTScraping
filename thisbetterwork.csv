"The study enrollment period will last one year, consisting of a six month intervention and a follow-up at month 12. The intervention will take place in two phases. In the first phase, 2/3 of participants will be randomly offered incentives for a period of 2 months (“rewards contract”). These participants accrue monetary rewards for (a) engaging in clinic and web-based activities that support smoking cessation (“process”)  and (b) quitting smoking by period end (“outcome”). CHCI will administer CO breathalyzer and urine anabasine/anatabine tests  to biochemically verify self-reports of smoking abstinence (“confirmatory test”).  Participants who test positive for smoking forfeit all accrued process rewards and do not receive outcome rewards.  Participants who test negative for smoking may redeem 100% of their Phase I rewards. ,A random subset of rewards group members will have the option to roll a portion of their Phase I rewards  into a Phase II deposit contract, lasting four months. One quarter of incentive group participants can “pre-commit” to the deposit contract during study enrollment, one quarter will only receive the deposit contract offer at Phase I end, and half will not receive the offer at all.  Participants who form a deposit contract must achieve abstinence during the entire contractual period in order to recover their deposit at Phase II end. As in Phase I, self-reported abstinence will be biochemically verified.    ,At the conclusion of the enrollment year, all participants will be requested to visit the clinic to take a final confirmatory test. To observe whether smoking abstinence persists after removal of incentives, no performance incentives will be contingent on the result of the follow-up measurement at 12 months.,All study participants will be offered CHCI’s full menu of smoking cessation services (e.g. individual/group counseling, tobacco cessation medication management). However, participants randomized to the control group (no rewards contract) will neither receive incentives in Phase I nor a deposit contract in Phase II.

"The intervention aims to reduce avoidable Emergency Department attendances by sending a personal letter to people who have recently attended an Emergency Department, but whose health concerns could likely have been dealt with elsewhere.,Several trials in the US have evaluated the effect of information and mailing interventions on emergency department visits. A trial in a paediatric emergency department gave families receiving Medicaid information about the importance of primary care provision and helped families make appointments. (Grossman, Rich, & Johnson, 1998)  This decreased emergency department attendances by 11.1% over the six months following the intervention, however, there was no difference in utilisation between six and 24 months after the intervention. In a different trial, nearly 7000 households receiving Medicaid were randomly selected to be sent a booklet with information about common non-urgent conditions, encouraging the use of alternatives to emergency care, such as GPs, telephonic nurse advice, and self-care (Rector, Venus, & Laine, 1999). The intervention did not significantly reduce attendance at emergency departments. Both studies look at quite specific populations and the results may not be applicable in the UK NHS system. This trial presents information in a more concise and targeted way in order to avoid information overload.,To date, there have been various attempts to provide general information to NHS users about the alternatives to emergency departments. The most obvious examples are the regional ‘Choose Well’ programmes. The ‘Choose Well’ campaign is a national NHS initiative which aims to give people information so that they know where to go to find help with their health concerns, and how to care for themselves if they have a common illness or ailment. However, the campaign merely provides general information that is not linked to individual behaviour. This trial aims to provide patients who have recently made an avoidable visit to A&E with clear and simple information about what to do when an urgent care problem arises.,Grossman, L. K., Rich, L.

Furthermore, it shows how the impact of more involved parents on their children is amplified at the class level by peer group interaction. We build on a large-scale controlled experiment run in a French deprived educational district, where parents of middle-school children were invited to participate in a simple program of parent–school meetings on how to get better involved in their children's education. At the end of the school year, we find that treated families have increased their school-and home-based involvement activities. In turn, pupils of treatment classes have developed more positive behaviour and attitudes in school, notably in terms of truancy and disciplinary sanctions (with effects-size around 15% of a standard deviation). However, test scores did not improve under the intervention.

While in class, treatment group students also reported reducing the amount of time they spent not paying attention in class and had better relationships with their teachers than students who were attending public schools. Teachers were 27 percentage points more likely to express interest in the well-being of their students and 26 percentage points more likely to provide supplementary help, if necessary.   ,Students who attended Sourdun also had higher aspirations, and expressed greater interest in pursuing their higher education. They were nearly three times as likely to express interest in taking college-preparatory classes, and 25 percent more likely to say they wanted to attain a master’s degree. These changes were not immediate—students appeared to lose confidence in their abilities during their first year in residence at Sourdun, perhaps because they were exposed to a higher-performing peer group or were asked to do more difficult work. However, their confidence rebounded in the second year.  ,Mirroring the trend in students’ confidence in their work, after the first year at Sourdun there was no significant difference in French or math scores between the treatment and comparison groups, though math scores of students at Sourdun did improve after the second year. After two years, students’ average math score increased by 0.4 standard deviations, a substantial amount relative to other education interventions.

"The project will provide 56 small scale irrigation kits in the southern province of Gaza. The project will be implemented in the four drought affected districts of Guija Mabalane, Chicualacuala and Massengena. Since the number of farmers that are interested in receiving irrigation equipment will likely exceed the number that can be covered, a within village level selection procedure is necessary. The evaluation will test two different approaches to carry out the within village selection of beneficiaries to understand how different protocols can result in a more equitable distribution of benefits and if there are potential trade-offs between inclusion of smaller farmers and productivity gains. The main features of the models are:,Model 1 - Score-based targeting. Selection happens according to a fixed set of criteria for placing the schemes and is designed to prioritize the smaller farmers in the community. ,Model 2 - Decentralized Community-driven targeting.

"Manipulations,The primes used for the study consist of short video presentations (in English) and a writing task in which subjects are asked to summarize the main point of the primes. There are three conditions: emotional anti-religious argument, rational anti-religious argument, and control. Each prime is approximately 4 minutes long and consists of a speaker making various points about religion, or in the case of the control, about vegetables. The speaker is the same Kenyan narrator in all three videos. Bullet points summarizing the main arguments appear on the screen, accompanying the auditory presentation by the speaker. In the emotional condition, the speaker argues that any God must be very cruel if he allows so many people in the world to suffer, concluding that it is unlikely that God exists. In the rational condition, the speaker argues that the existence of God is unnecessary to explain the universe given our scientific knowledge. In the control condition, the same speaker instead argues that it is important to eat vegetables every day. After viewing the video presentations, participants are asked to summarize the main arguments in their own words by typing into a text box on their screen and then asked a series of questions to ensure comprehension. we will include analyses restricted based on comprehension as described below.

"Context,The study worked with a very particular sector in Kenya, the informal sector, commonly known as the “Jua Kali” (literally meaning “under the hot sun”) sector (Orwa 2007). The artisans, vendors, and mechanics in this sector face extreme vulnerability to illness, economic dislocation, and natural disasters. Yet, employment in Jua Kali increased by 5.1 million in 2002, accounting for 74.2 per cent of total non-farm employment, according to Kenyas Central Bureau of Statistics. The Jua Kali sector encompasses small-scale entrepreneurs and workers who lack access to credit, property rights, training, and good working conditions. JKA workers supply goods to local markets using predominantly manual labor and little capital, often making do with handmade tools. Their workshops and stands frequently lack electricity and running water. These workers are organized into various sheds built out of metal sheets that give little protection from the elements. Given the extreme health hazards that they face, Jua Kali workers can stand to benefit from insurance schemes that provide coverage in the event of workplace accidents.,Micro-Health Insurance,Subjects receiving insurance enrolled in the CIC Afya Bora plan, a combined inpatient and outpatient family health insurance policy. These treated households received inpatient benefits of up to KSH 250,000 per family that covered the costs of:,• Hospital accommodation charges for a general ward bed in contracted hospitals • Doctor and healthcare professional fees,• Prescribed routine lab tests,• X-ray and ultrasound tests,• ICU, HDU, and theatre charges,• Prescribed medicines, dressings, and internal surgical appliances,• Routing diagnostic lab tests,• Day care surgery,• Maternity including non-elective caesarean section with 6 mo. waiting period,• Chronic and pre-existing conditions up to KSH 75,000,Households also received outpatient benefits of up to KSH 50,000 per family that,covered:,• Routine outpatient consultation,• Diagnostic laboratory and radiology services,• Prescribed medicine and dressings,• HIV/AIDS related conditions and prescribed ARVs,• Routine immunizations,• Routine prenatal check ups,• Postnatal care up to six weeks after delivery,• Pre-existing and chronic conditions up to KSH 20,000 • Outpatient oncology,• Psychiatry and psychotherapy,Beneficiaries paid KSH 100 for each outpatient visit. Both covers included chronic and pre-existing conditions, including HIV/AIDS but excluded treatment outside Kenya, cosmetic treatment, treatment by non-qualified persons, infertility, self-inflicted injury, ex- perimental treatment, and dental treatment unless occassioned by accidental injury. Ben- eficiaries could access these benefits through CIC’s network of providers that included 26 mission and faith based hospitals in Nairobi.,The plan provided benefits to principals and spouses under 72 years old and children dependents younger than 25 years with proof of enrollment in school or college. Subjects were enrolled in the Afya Bora plan free of charge for one year, a value of KSH 12,745 for the principal, spouse and up to five dependents. Each additional child dependent increased the annual premium by KSH 2,000 per child. The project fully reimbursed households for the base cost and any added premium.,Unconditional Cash Transfer,Subjects in the second treatment group received an unconditional cash transfer equal to the net value of the annual premium they would have had to pay had they enrolled in the CIC Afya Bora scheme. The transfer was delivered to recipients electronically using the M-Pesa mobile money service. M-Pesa is a mobile money system offered by Safaricom, the largest Kenyan mobile phone operator. Using M-Pesa requires a registered SIM card and a valid Kenyan national ID card. The project transfered the money from Innovations for Poverty Action Kenya’s (IPA-K) M-Pesa account to that of the recipient. To facilitate the transfers, we encouraged recipients to sign up for M-Pesa and helped them obtain, where necessary, all of the requirements for registration. The cash was transferred to the registered SIM card wirelessly and the recipient could withdraw the balance at an M-Pesa agent by putting the SIM card into the agents cell phone or by using their own phone.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000647,"McGill University,MIT,IPA Kenya","2010-09-17,2011-10-20,2010-09-30",,"March 02, 2015",,,,,,,,,"113-0910,1109004672,N/A"

"The program- Incentives,Operation ASHA hires community-based health workers, who are each responsible for operating two DOTS centers. During the first three months, CHWs all receive a fixed salary. Indeed, centers often take a slow start, irrespective of the involvement of the CHW. This initial 3-month period also enables the CHWs to get their bearings in a new place and for the center to be identified by the population. The experiment starts after the initial three months of a center lifespan. Between 3 and approximately 9 months, CHWs have to grow their center until they have reached the optimal size (not more than 50 patients), where they are cost-effective and where patients can be effectively followed-up. Half of the CHWs, randomly chosen, receive a fixed component and a variable amount based on their performance regarding detection of new patients, while the other half receives a fixed salary. ,After nine months of work, CHWs should focus on preventing defaults. The CHW's compensation scheme is randomized again. Half of them receive a fixed salary for the following 6 months of their contract while the other half receive an incentivized scheme where the variable component no longer depends on the number of detections, but on the number of defaults they prevent. If the number of patients keeps growing, Operation ASHA opens a new center and the detection work is taken over by another CHW operating that newly open center. ,These incentives (for detection) or penalties (for default) come in addition to a base salary, that guarantees the health workers that they will get a minimum amount for their work, whatever happens, and thereby contains the amount of risk and stress they are facing. The introduction of financial incentives explicitly linked to the outcome of their counselling work is aimed at increasing their motivation, effort, and performance, and in turn their impact on TB treatment in slums. ,The Program- Biometrics,Additionally, there is a second intervention designed to enhance treatment compliance: biometric devices enabling to monitor the absenteeism of Operation ASHA’s health workers, as well as the pills intake by the patients, patient satisfaction, and patient health outcomes.Operation Asha (OA), developed a biometric identification system, eCompliance, based on a fingerprint scanner connected to a low-end computer and cellphone, which were randomly assigned to each counselor. ",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000038,"Institute of Financial Management and Research (IFMR), Institutional Review Board (IRB),Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Institutional Review Board (IRB)","2011-08-08,2013-05-09",,"August 18, 2014",,,,,,,,,"IRB00007107,1103004410"

"In partnership with a local microfinance organization and a local university, we distribute a simple savings technology - a moneybox - to smallholder farmers in northern Ethiopia. The handing out of the boxes is embedded in the answering of a survey questionnaire during private household visits. This allows for a clean implementation of the experimental design.,In the process of handing out the moneyboxes, we randomize five messages right after farmers formulate a savings goal for which they want to save with the moneybox. Four of the five messages are persuasive in the sense that they recommend households to save for higher or lower amounts than initially formulated. After receiving the message, farmers can voluntarily adjust their savings goal with respect to the savings amount.,The fifth message does not contain a recommendation. Furthermore, we cross-randomize the recommendation to save in a daily or a weekly frequency towards the savings goal. In addition, there is a pure control group receiving neither moneyboxes nor messages. In a nutshell, the experimental procedure follows the following steps:,1. We ask respondents to name and explain the most important savings goal they would like to save for.,2. We ask respondents how much they want to save for this goal in the next 8-24 weeks (2-6 months).,3. Depending on the treatment arm (and holding the time period fixed), we read out one of these sentences:,Our experience shows that people are more likely to reach their savings goal if they have higher goal amounts.

Do you want to decrease the amount of your savings goal to... [Calculate goalamount*0.6]?,4. Given the persuasive message, we asked participants whether they want to adjust their goal amount.,5. Depending on the treatment arm, we recommend to save either in weekly or daily intervals.,6. Then we asked participants to write down the following information on the label of the moneybox: The savings goal (written or drawn), the goal amount in Birr (considering the adjustment after the persuasive message), the savings installment in Birr, whether the savings frequency is weekly or daily and the end date. The goal amount will serve as a reference points for respondents for their savings activities.

"Street-food vending in developing countries is one of the most common job for urban poor, both migrant job-seekers and urban unemployed. This micro-entrepreneurial activity is mostly conducted in a tolerated but informal sector. Vendors distribute affordable goods and services to consumers and form a vital part of the social and economic life of a city. However, street food vending represents also a source of major public health issues. The main concern is a general lack of knowledge of street vendors in basic food safety measures. Moreover, the risks to public health are exacerbated by poor hygiene, inadequate access to clean water and waste disposal, and unhealthy surroundings. International organizations such as the FAO and the WHO have repeatedly pointed out the urgency of addressing concerns related to street vending in developing countries. ,The aim of this project is to investigate whether, and why, self-regulation - in terms of improvements of hygienic standards and health hazards - might take place among street-food vendors in urban India. The project will take place in Kolkata and it will be based on a RCT on about 930 street-food vendors. Vendors will be eligible to attend a training program aimed at building their capacity to make such improvements.,The training is designed in collaboration with Innoaid, a nongovernment organization (NGO) from Denmark, following WHO's guidelines aimed at: i) enhance vendors' awareness of health risks related to food vending (foodborne illnesses) 1 ; ii) building their capacity to make the necessary improvements in food-quality - specifically, the training will focus on a set of tools as: importance of hands cleaning, vendors' personal hygiene, use of containers for water, food covering, availability of paper plates and cups, waste management and business practices -. A careful field data collection before, during and after the training - will allow testing the effect of the training on vendors' behaviors in terms of food safety hazards and on their overall performances.,At the end of the training, vendors will be randomly allocated to different treatments to test which incentives drive self-regulatory behaviours - namely Treatment groups 1, 2, 3, and Control group. T1 will only receive the training, and it represents our baseline treatment. T2, in addition of the training, receives some promotional material related to the content of the training. As this ""signal"" is visible to the clients, we might expect a higher impact of the training due to reputational effects. Finally, T3 tests whether monetary incentive can drive a change. Specifically, vendors are eligible to receive a monetary reward depending upon their ability to improve their performance in terms of hygiene and health hazards.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000750,,,,"October 13, 2015",,,,,,,,,

EPIICA is piloting the sale of WII tied with short-term production credit. To that end, a baseline survey was conducted in early 2011 in 120 rural Kebeles (villages or farmer associations) in four zones of the Amhara region in Ethiopia . The choice of the Kebeles was non-random but instead was designed on the basis of informed opinion of NISCO as to where in the Amhara region the market for WII has best potential. Households within the selected kebeles were randomly sampled to participate in the study; in each village 18 cooperative households and 2 households that are not a member of the primary cooperative were selected.  Because fertilizers are procured exclusively through primary cooperatives and their upper level zonal Cooperative Unions (CUs) in Ethiopia, it is anticipated that cooperative households may display a higher propensity to uptake additional fertilizer if risk concerns can be ameliorated.   ,The core of the project is a rainfall index insurance product pioneered by Nyala Insurance Company.  This product is based on rainfall as measured at 8 different rainfall stations in Amhara, operated by the National Meteorological Agency (NMA).  Farmers could purchase insurance prior to the planting season for a specified crop and quantity of land, and for an amount up to the total cost of inputs for the size of land planted to a given crop. For each crop and location an index has been designed based on local meteorological conditions and crop water requirements that predicts partial or total crop failure based on realized rainfall measurements.  If the index indicates a partial crop failure, the insurance makes a partial payout.  If the index indicates total crop failure, the insurance will make a full payout.  The intent is that farmers are insuring the cost of their inputs (not the total value of the harvest), and so the payouts are designed to reimburse farmers for lost input investments, and thereby enable them to take more risk in the use of fertilizers and improved seeds.  If the farmers take a loan to purchase the inputs, then the insurance basically acts as collateral, for default that can be caused by weather events as seen in the index, to the Bank for the amount lent.  ,The EPIICA study is a state-of-the art scientific pilot, which, after having designed the relevant weather indices and loan products, implements a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to generate an experimental control group and thereby to measure the impact of the program on farm productivity and household welfare, as well as the institutional profitability of Nyala and Dashen.  The study is a two-armed trial, comparing two distinct ways of implementing weather insurance.  The first of them, the Standalone product, offers only an index insurance product to farmers in 17 kebele cooperatives.  Here, farmers can purchase insurance (although the costs of the insurance premiums may be financed by the cooperatives in some cases) and receive payouts if inadequate rainfall is measured at the nearest rainfall station. The second is the Interlinked product, in which the project provides insured credit to cooperative farmers in 17 additional kebeles.  For the Interlinked product, farmers will first purchase insurance from Nyala, and are then eligible to access credit from Dashen Bank for an amount up to the sum insured by the index product.  On Interlinked loans the insurance contract is written over to Dashen as a form of collateral - for default that can be caused by weather events as seen in the index.Dashen Bank has accepted to use this type of insurance contract as an innovative form of partial collateral in this pilot. If the weather is good, and hence the rainfall index does not trigger insurance payments, the farmers must repay this loan plus interest.  If the weather is bad, then the loan will be partially or completely forgiven based on the insurance payout that will be made directly from Nyala to Dashen",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000451,UCSD Human Research Protections Program,2010-10-08,,"July 22, 2014",,,,,,,,,101578
"Our study evaluates the impact of the construction of transitional housing build by the NGO TECHO. The model used by TECHO is designed to serve what are known as “irregular settlements” in Latin America and the Caribbean. The term “irregular settlement” refers to a community comprised of families that inhabit plots which they do not own. Settlements inhabitants are plagued by a host of problems in terms of their living conditions, such as insufficient access to basic services (water, electricity and sanitation), significant levels of soil and water contamination, and overcrowding. The typical housing units in these informal settlements are no better than their surroundings, as they are mostly rudimentary units constructed from discarded materials and have dirt floors.  ,The TECHO housing units are one-room houses (6m by 3m) made of pre-fabricated, insulated pinewood panels to protect the occupants from humidity and insects; their roofs are made of tin. In order to reduce dampness and protect occupants from floods and infestations, the floor is built on top of 15 stacks that raise it up to between 30 and 80 centimeters off the ground. Units are modular and portable, are constructed with simple tools, and are set up by volunteers working in squads of 4-8 members. ,Although these houses are a major improvement over the recipients’ previous housing situation, the facilities they offer are limited, as they do not include a bathroom or kitchen or amenities such as plumbing, drinking water hook-ups, or gas connections. Nor do these houses, in and of themselves, protect children or families from many of the environmental risks that they face, since family members spend only a fraction of every day in the TECHO houses.,The cost of each transitional housing unit is around $1,000, and the beneficiary family contributes 10% of that sum. (In El Salvador, this is approximately equivalent to 3 months’ worth of earnings at the baseline level, while in Mexico and Uruguay, it is roughly equivalent to 1.4 months’ worth of earnings.) ",,No,No,We have 2210 households at the endline survey,No,,,AEARCTR-0000414,University of California at Berkeley,2008-01-18,"April 30, 2012 12:00 AM +00:00","June 28, 2014",http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2296901,"We have 398 households offered treatment in El Salvador and 258 households in the control group.

Our findings show that better houses have a positive effect on overall housing conditions and general well-being: treated households are happier with their quality of life. In two countries, we also document improvements in children’s health; in El Salvador, slum dwellers also feel that they are safer. We do not find this result, however, in the other two experimental samples. There are no other noticeable robust effects on the possession of durable goods or in terms of labor outcomes.

"The Fuel Fund of Maryland (FF) is an NGO that has been providing financial assistance for over thirty years. When unable to honor their energy bills and at risk of having their energy service turned off by Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), low-income residents from Maryland can request financial assistance. The debt is split into thirds, shared by BGE, FF, and the customer.  Since 2008, FF has also been running Watt Watchers (WW), a program that provides energy education and outlines demand-side energy reduction strategies for clients in need of bill assistance. ,Watt Watchers is a heavily underutilized program that through Summer 2014 was optional to FF clients. Starting in the Fall 2014, completing the WW training became a requirement in order to qualify for bill assistance. WW also began rolling out an online tool around the same time. We took advantage of these two changes to design an extremely simple, valid, and low-cost intervention. ,At registration, clients get randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group for whom training is not required; a treatment group where clients are required to take the 45-minute online course; and a second treatment group where clients are required to participate in two 90-minute on-site sessions led by FF. We are not expecting full compliance in the study. FF cannot deny financial help even if the training is not completed. These clients are about to get their electricity and/or gas shut off, and FF’s mission is to help families afford energy, especially during winter. Because of this, a simple comparison of averages between control and treatments will solely measure ITT. Although the ITT is arguably interesting for policy reasons, we will also estimate a two-stage least squares regression, instrumenting on assignment to a group.,FF started randomly assigning clients to groups in October 2014. In March, we will start randomizing the contents of confirmation letter that WW sends after registration to measure its effects on compliance. Two additional randomizations will be put in place. First, to understand the most cost-effective way to generate compliance, we will randomize t reated clients (on-site/online) into three groups. After registering, some will receive a simple confirmation letter; some will receive this same letter, with a also informing them that they have the chance to enter a lottery for an autographed Ravens football if they complete their WW training; and a third group will receive the same letter, and inform them that they have the chance to enter a lottery for a gift card of approximately the same financial value as the Ravens football if they complete their WW training ($250).,Second, part of the WW curriculum involves rewarding on-site participants with a gift bag containing energy-related goods after the completion of the course. We want to understand the impact of this gift on energy consumption. For this, we will randomize online participants to receive or not the same gift bag after they complete the training.

"The proposed research builds upon our pilot study (MIT Subaward Agreement No. 5710003). The two aims of the pilot were: (i) Developing effective information treatments; and (ii) Identifying feasible and appropriate services and target populations. We have now successfully developed and tested information treatments. Results from over 200 representative urban and rural respondents show that specific (accurate) positive informational primes on state actors do lead to positively (negatively) updating towards the state (non-state) actor. These results hold across subjective survey and experimental game outcomes. In addition, we have identified dispute resolution as a service where non-state actors are playing increasingly important roles and pose direct challenges to state authority. This has helped us develop specific ""exposure treatments"" pertinent to dispute resolution, establish partnerships with relevant players, and identify individuals at initial stages of a dispute, thus allowing us to measure the impact of the interventions on actual engagement in addition to survey and experimental outcomes.,Specifically, we propose to introduce three types of ""exposure treatments"" about dispute resolution services at the individual level. These treatments will vary in intensity from low to medium to high (from simple information provision about changes in effectiveness of the actor to real experiences with changed services). We examine how moving from low to high intensity treatments will impact beliefs about state (non-state) actors and movement away from non-state (state) options for dispute resolution. We will also study whether actual citizen engagement varies with the strength of exposure. Within each treatment type we also hope to introduce further variants that will shed light on when and why movements to state/non-state actors occur. We begin by discussing service and partner identification, move to sample identification, elaborate on the specific treatments in the study and then outline our data and methodology.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000602,"Harvard University Committee on the Use of Human Subjects,MIT Committee On the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects","2014-11-19,2014-10-17",,"February 02, 2015",,,,,,,,,"IRB14-3923,1407006522"

"Indian drivers generally do not know the true value of fines for traffic infringements. If they overestimate what the fine would be, which previous data had indicated was the case, then they may elect to pay bribes, and even bribe amounts larger than legal fine. In response, our intervention informs drivers of the true fine amounts for one particular, observable offense: driving a motorcycle without a helmet. ,To do this, we call all respondents from our baseline survey to ask if they would like to take our followup survey, and while doing this, inform half about the true fine value for riding a motorcycle without a helmet. This was done twice: once about a month after they completed the survey, and once again three months after that. We also sent a text message to both control and treatment drivers at those times, where both were reminded of the dangers of riding without a helmet, while treatment drivers were also told the true fine value for doing so.,After the information campaign, and approximately 9 months after the baseline survey, phone respondents were called for an endline survey and incentivized by an offer of mobile airtime in exchange for answering questions. This panel approach is necessary for us to examine how the effect of information interacts with drivers' priors on fine amounts. The survey also provides insight into the response of the police to greater driver knowledge of fine amounts.

"Venezuela’s capital city, Caracas, is comprised of five municipalities, the second of which is Sucre, with an estimated population near 1 MM, covering 164 of the city’s 777 square kilometers. Sucre houses approximately 7,200 firms, requiring a municipal commercial permit. Taxes collected from these firms represent over 60% of total municipal tax income, so compliance with the local business tax represents a very significant matter for local finances. The historical archive includes over 9,000 firms, about 20% of which have had no fiscal activity over the previous three years, which can be interpreted as firms switching to the informal sector, or equivalently, choosing not to report their earnings and evade the corresponding taxes. Of the 7,200 active firms, about 900 were excluded from the study because they were located in sparsely populated (almost rural) areas within the municipality which make them hard to reach and therefore costly to get a communication to via private courier. ,We empirically asses the relative importance of both the deterrence and tax morale models for explaining tax compliance. We follow the existing literature that induces an exogenous change in firm’s perception about tax control, on one hand, and of moral suasion, on the other, by randomly sending letters to different treatment groups. Specifically, we divide the entire study sample into six groups and send letters to five different groups of firms5. One letter described planned changes in the municipal tax administration office that would improve tax control and enforcement. In particular it mentions the hiring of new inspectors and vehicles that will facilitate the implementation of audits and also the acquisition of new information and technology systems that will allow a more precise identification of tax payers. Another letter aimed at strengthening tax morale by simply stressing the importance of complying with tax obligations. Two additional letters investigate the reciprocity hypothesis. One informs about policies geared to improving the provision of general public goods and business services. For example, it details policies aiming at strengthening citizen security (police), basic infrastructure (public transportation, public lighting and waste management) and formal economic activity (control of illegal commerce). A second letter mentions initiatives regarding social assistance for the poor and the elderly, and improvements in public health services.

We evaluate this hypothesis by tracking the local business tax compliance of over 6,000 firms in a major municipality in Caracas, which we randomly assigned to a control of no stimulus, or to one of five treatment arms that received letters from the local tax administrator with different types of messages regarding tax compliance. We find that an enforcement message has the largest compliance effect, while moral suasion appears less effective. However, differences between letter types have impacts that cannot be statistically distinguished from each other, which we interpret as an effect of being contacted by the tax authority by written communication, regardless of the content. This is most likely to matter for firms unaccustomed to contact with the government –small firms– which are also those for which we find economically large effects.",

"The UCT Program implemented by GiveDirectly Inc. (GD) targets impoverished households in Kenya. The study evaluates GD’s intervention in the Rarieda District, in Western Kenya. GD’s intended beneficiaries are especially disadvantaged households, with per capita incomes below $1 per day. Households are identified as eligible using objective and transparent criteria that are highly correlated with poverty: dwellings lacking solid walls, floors, or roofs.,GD’s goal is to provide flexible financial assistance to those in greatest need, while maximizing cost efficiency by transferring cash electronically using M-Pesa mobile money technology, a key innovative feature of the program. M-Pesa is a mobile money system offered by Safaricom, the largest Kenyan mobile phone operator. GD transfers the money from GD’s M-Pesa account to that of the recipient. To facilitate the transfers, GD distributes a SIM card and asks the recipient to sign up for M-Pesa; then, money is transferred to the SIM card, and the recipient can withdraw the balance at an M-Pesa agent by putting the SIM card into the agent's cell phone, or using their own phone. ,This delivery method drastically cuts the costs of reaching the recipient: GD transfers 90% of the program’s total budget directly to a poor household, with the remainder covering recipient identification, including staff costs (7%), and mobile transfer fees for both GD and recipients (3%). Not only is the intervention cheap; the insights from the study can also be applied broadly, as the program can be implemented in any area with access to mobile money technology.

"The interventions were conducted in two blocks (district subdivisions) of the Purnia district in Bihar and two blocks of the Ajmer district in Rajasthan. Bihar and Rajasthan were selected by Pratham based on the low literacy levels of the two states. According to the latest census, these states have the lowest female literacy rates in India at roughly 53% each (Census of India, 2011). Children's education outcomes are similar between the two states. For example, 48% of rural children in grades 3 to 5 can read at a grade 1 level in both states, just below the national average of 54% (ASER Centre, 2013). The intervention districts within each state were selected because of existing Pratham programs and infrastructure in those areas. Within the intervention districts, the blocks were selected because they did not have any pre-existing Pratham programs.,There were three interventions that were tested. Mothers of children aged 5-8 years-old were assigned to one of the following three treatment groups or a comparison group, which received no additional services.,The Mother Literacy (ML) intervention consisted of daily literacy classes held in the villages. In each location, a volunteer was recruited from the community to teach classes for two hours per day at the time and place that was most convenient to interested women. Volunteers utilized a version of Pratham's Read India methodology. This approach, shown effective in teaching children to read, was modified to suit the interests of adults. While ML classes were open to any who wished to attend, Pratham staff and volunteers were given a list of target mothers to recruit into the classes.,The Child and Mother Activities Packet (CHAMP) intervention was designed to engage the mothers at home with their children's learning. Once per week, a Pratham staff member visited each target mother and gave her a worksheet to help her child complete. Mothers were also given instruction on how to review her child's school notebooks, discuss child learning with her child's school teacher, and encourage the child to do school work at home.,The combined intervention (ML-CHAMP) included both the ML and CHAMP interventions.

"Researchers are conducting a randomized evaluation to explore the impact of allowing JUNTOS beneficiaries to collect their payments though branchless banking agents. In the branchless banking system, local bank agents, typically shopkeepers, serve as deposit and withdrawal points for account holders to access their funds with debit cards. The agent based network, which the project is installing in shops and municipalities will allow the national bank to increase the number of withdrawal points for JUNTOS users, reducing transportation costs and potentially giving users a greater degree of access to their accounts. If this is the case, users may begin to use their account to save more of their JUNTOS payments, making smaller and more frequent withdrawals. ,In order to evaluate the effect of branchless banking, a sample of 59 sub-regional districts, each with approximately 400 JUNTOS beneficiaries, will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. ,In the first group, branchless banking agents will be established in each district, allowing beneficiaries to access and withdraw funds from their JUNTOS accounts.The second group will serve as a comparison group, where branchless banking agents will not be introduced for the duration of the evaluation period. ,Within the 30 treatment districts, 140 villages or ""centros poblados"" will be randomly assigned into one of two subgroups to evaluate a workshop aimed at increasing trust and empowerment of users in the financial system. 70 villages will receive the workshop and 70 will act as controls. ,One year after banking agents are introduced, the researchers will collect information on savings and consumption behavior from household surveys.

"TPROG is the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform of a multinational company with longstanding operations in Venezuela and every other country in Latin America. With a focus on adult education, the program has five thematic areas: hospitality, retail, enterprise, bartending and teaching. The program's goal is to train (in a period of 2 months) unemployed or informal workers in skills that enable them to expand their employment opportunities, increase their income and strengthen their civic values. This program is replicated throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, as it is TFIRM’s most prominent CSR initiative in the region.,The program’s 2010 edition in Venezuela consisted of two courses: Retailing and Bartender. Both courses were completely free and were aimed at people living in Caracas, over 18 years-old, unemployed or in the informal sector, and who at the time of the invitation had completed at least the 3rd year of high school (9th grade of basic education).,Eligible individuals could choose between the two types of training, each offered in different locations: Retailing, offered in “Sabana Grande” a very accessible commercial area in the center of Caracas, and Bartender, located on the southern outskirts of the city on the campus of Simón Bolívar University in the “Sartenejas Valley”. The retailing course includes marketing topics, product display in shelves and aisles, customer service and stock administration, and the Bartender course trains participants in the preparation of drinks and spirits, customer service, hospitality, English and Flair practices. Both courses were certified by the Simon Bolivar University (one of the most prestigious universities in the country), for a period of two months, 3 days a week, part time. Both courses included personal growth modules, responsible drinking and job readiness training. Only participants with less than 3 absences could get the course’s final certification.,Additionally, program attendees enjoyed free transportation to the farther location, refreshments on site and awards for perfect attendance.",,Yes,No,600 individuals (147 actually attended the training and 82 received certification.

"Subsidy,In this treatment group, we offer free (or 90% subsidy) health insurance.

But VCT could also be a powerful prevention tool. By providing personalized counseling as well as information about high-risk behaviors, VCT could motivate people to adopt safer sexual behavior and prevent transmission of HIV. This could be particularly important for adolescents and young adults, who typically have had their sexual debut but might not have perfect information about HIV risk.

"Domestic violence is a sensitive topic and as such we will find reticent respondents, i.e., those who give false answers with a nonzero probability when an honest answer could reveal that the person has committed or been exposed to a sensitive act. We compare the protocols used by the Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) against a new design. The DHS is a nationally representative survey that includes a module to measure domestic violence and has been used in Peru for the past 14 years. Thus, by relying on the DHS methods and questions we will be able to frame our findings relative to well-established measures of violence nationwide. Our alternative method tries to capture violence against women in an innovative way, called list experiments, that is sometimes used in political science (Blair and Imai 2012). In list experiments subjects are provided with a list of statements and asked to answer how many of them are true. Subjects are not asked about which ones are true and therefore, list experiments could provide a more private environment to answer questions on sensitive topics more honesty. In this setting, the control group receives a list of innocuos statements (e.g., ""I had breakfast this morning""). The treatment group is read the same list plus one additional sensitive question.

"The proposed research will take place in Livingstone, Zambia, a city of around 140,000 located near Victoria Falls. The research partner, the Southern Water and Sewerage Company (SWSC), serves around 16,000 residential customers with metered household water connections. Like many urban services around the world, water is billed on an increasing block tariff, with three price tiers (kinks at 6 and 20 cubic meters). Analysis of historical billing data shared by SWSC indicates that consumption spans all three price tiers and that consumption varies from month to month at the customer level. Customers receive monthly bills based on consumption on each of the tiers. Our pilot phase confirms that customers have a low level of awareness of their water price, their consumption and how their bill is calculated. This lack of awareness undermines the price incentive that the increasing tariff is intended to deliver. This lack of awareness also creates a research opportunity. Providing selected households with accurate information about their marginal prices serves as a shock to their price beliefs. Piloting of how to frame price information suggests that describing price as the cost of running the tap for a fixed period of time is most salient to households. Analysis will rely both on administrative records from SWSC and on original data collected through surveys conducted by IPA.,Study sample,We will study the water consumption of households in Livingstone, all of which have been on metered water accounts for at least one year, have a currently well-functioning meter and are cohabiting or married. Households will be selected using existing billing records and a pre-screening visit. Based on the pilots from June-September 2014, roughly 35% of the households visited for screening met these criteria and were eligible for inclusion in our sample. Among eligible households, the modal age group for husbands and wives in the pilot sample was 31-40 years; the modal educational attainment was some college (post-secondary diploma or certificate) for men and Grade 12 (secondary schooling) for women.,Data collection and price variation,A single survey visit will be used to collect household-specific information and to provide salient price information to a sub-sample of households. The data collection and interventions consists of five parts:,1) Beliefs about water prices: Both the male and female heads of household will be asked about their beliefs about water prices. They will be asked both to state the marginal price (described in terms of ""running a tap for normal household use”) and their confidence around that estimate. We refined elicitation of price beliefs during piloting. SWSC measures water usage in cubic meters, which is a unit of measurement that is hard for most users to translate into regular usage decisions. We piloted a number of different ways to elicit price beliefs, before settling on a framing that was straightforward for respondents. We ask, “Suppose you wanted to save K. 10 on your monthly bill. Then by how many minutes would your household as a whole have to reduce the use of the tap each day? Think about running the tap at a normal pressure, as you would for typical daily activities.” While the correct answer for most households in the middle pricing tier is 13 minutes, the average belief from the pilots was about 23 minutes, with responses ranging from 2 minutes to 60 minutes.,2) Household survey: Male and female household heads will be interviewed together and separated for a subset of questions and incentivized games. Together, they will be asked a series of questions about household demographics, income and water usage. Questions about income and water consuming durables will help characterize one dimension of heterogeneity in price sensitivity across households. Separately, they will be asked about the water usage decisions of each member of the household including themselves. Comparing answers about own and other's water usage across spouses will reveal how well informed household members are about the usage decisions made by others. In addition to standard survey measures, the male and female household heads will be asked to play two simple incentivized games that will be used to measure cooperation within the household. A measure of altruism toward the environment will serve as a control. These measures will be used to characterize the second dimension of heterogeneity. The survey and incentivized games were refined during piloting. In a modified dictator game, played between spouses, 25% of the husbands and 15% of wives sent their full endowment to their spouse, knowing that it would be doubled if that game were selected for implementation. On average, husbands sent 65% of their endowment to their wives and wives sent 45% of their endowment to their husbands. Controlling for gender, we find that the share of the endowment sent to the spouse is strongly correlated with other measures of household coordination such as whether the respondent says they regularly make plans with their spouse and whether they find it difficult to hide income from their spouse.,3) Price information: Following completion of the household survey, respondents will be given information about the true price of water that they face. Using the average across recent months, individuals will be told their expected marginal price in the coming month, again using easy to understand language (“running the tap”). To ensure the salience of the intervention, households will also be provided with written materials describing their marginal water price. 25% of the survey sample will receive this price information intervention.,4) SWSC credibility: Based on our piloting of the price-information intervention, we found that people doubt the accuracy of their bills, and sometimes think that the water company charges them for more water than they actually use. This is partly justified, because their analog water meters are difficult to read. In addition, the combination of water outages due to infrastructure constraints and annual increases in water prices has led people to think poorly of the water company. People's skepticism about their billing and the potential to actually save money by lowering their water consumption would limit the effectiveness of our information intervention. To overcome this, we have added a second treatment wherein a subset of the households in the treatment and control groups for the information treatment receive additional information about the water company. Specifically, roughly 50% of the overall study sample will be informed that the water company is committed to honest billing practices, and that they try to make the water bills as accurate as possible by reading the meters monthly and using the meter readings to generate the bills. We explain that even during months where the meter is inaccessible or unreadable, the bill is based on an average of previous months' usage, and that future bills are adjusted for any over- or under- charges once they are able to get a reading again. This is information households may not have had previously, and could lead them to take the price information we provide more seriously. ,5) Lottery: We are adding a third treatment based on the pilot exercise and due to the additional grant funding we received from the IGC, as well as from the Urban Services Initiative at J-PAL. The treatment is a raffle for successful water conservation outcomes by participating households. We will inform a randomly selected subset of the sample that lowering their monthly water usage will qualify them to participate in the raffle. These households will also be given the price information. Prizes of 300K (about 50USD) will be given to one in every twenty households that make the required reduction each month. The raffle provides households with a clear incentive to reduce water use and allows us to directly observe which households are successful at lowering consumption and which are not. For a third of the households told about the raffle; only the husband will be informed about the raffle; for the other third, only the wife will be informed; and for the rest of the households, both spouses will be informed.  We will randomly assign whether the target respondent(s) in each household will be the husband, the wife, or both spouses. Households will be automatically entered in the raffle if they reduce their water usage during the following billing period to a specific target. The surveyors will also show them where on the bill they can find the water usage for that month, so that the respondents can keep track of their usage and know if they have met their target or not. Households can continue to try and qualify for the raffle in future months until we end the program. For the vast majority of households, we believe this will be an interesting challenge that will help them save money and better understand their water price and billing. It will also assist the research by helping us to understand the role of water costs in the amount the household consumes. For example, if the lottery is effective, we can conclude that water prices affect consumption decisions. If the effectiveness varies depending on whether the couple both learn about the lottery versus if one individual in the couple learns about the lottery, then we can conclude that the importance of price depends on who knows about it and who benefits from cutbacks.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000660,"Zambia ERES Converge,Tufts University Social, Behavioral and Educational Research Institutional Review Board,Northwestern University Institutional Review Board","2015-02-10,2015-02-03,2014-07-22",,"March 20, 2015",,,,,,,,,"NA,1410031,STU00097568"

Distribution of the MDWC:  The MDWC will be distributed to pharmacies and other outlets by SFH located in the geographic areas where the study will be implemented. The distribution of the MDWC will take place across both study arms. Information regarding where the MDWC is stocked and how often it is available will be collected throughout the study to determine availability of the product and whether that varies across wards. ,2.	Mass Media:  The MDWC will be advertised widely, targeting young adults through radio, billboards, news media, social media, and a mobile website. This mass media platform will be implemented across both study arms. The mobile website will be branded under “Smart Sex”, and will disseminate information about family planning and serve as an interactive forum for young men and women to ask sexual health related questions and generally discuss SRH related topics.  SMS blasts and social media messaging will be used to direct individuals to the website. There will also be a “Brand Ambassador” who will serve as a spokesperson for the website and for the MDWC.  The website will serve as the main venue for the introduction and promotion of the MDWC. Mass media will be targeted to young, urban adults (ages 18 to 24 years) of both genders.,3.	Inter-Personal Communication (IPC): IPC agents will be recruited from IPC points within the intervention arm and they will be trained by SFH on communication skills, sexual and reproductive health, technical specifications and use of the Maximum Diva Woman’s Condom, and condom negotiation skills. IPC agents will set up an IPC point in a high traffic area(s) of each ward selected for the intervention arm for initial demand creation, and use their existing and new contacts to access networks of young people in the area for smaller group and on-on-one information sessions. The IPC intervention will be comprised of communication messages focused on how to use and the benefits of the use of MDWCs and MCs for the prevention of unplanned pregnancies.

"The first phase is common to all firms, and includes a detailed diagnostic of 5 different areas (Logistics, Human Resources, Finance, Marketing and Sales, and Production) implemented by a team of 6 consultants, 5 of them specialists in each specific area analyzed and one team leader coordinating the process. This diagnostic phase lasts 2 full-time weeks and is completed by a report that analyzes both managerial practices for each one of these areas and key performance indicators associated with each one of the areas analyzed ,There are two interventions being piloted, which will be received by different treatment groups:,1) Individual consulting services support: Firms assigned to this group will receive individual support of a team of 5 consultants for 5 different processes: Logistic, Human Resources, Finance, Marketing and Sales, and Production during a period of 4-6 months to implement a set of improved managerial practices prioritized for their potential impact on growth and productivity of the businesses based on the diagnostic performed in phase one. ,2) Group consulting services support: Firms assigned to this group will receive group support of a team of 6 consultants for 4-6 months to implement a set of improved managerial practices prioritized for their potential impact on growth and productivity of the businesses based on the diagnostic performed in phase one. The difference with the individual support is that groups of 5 or 6 firms located in the same region receive a group intervention. Leaders from the firms in a group sign an agreement to work together and help each other improve. Training in particular topic areas first occurs in a group class setting, with each firm sending the people in charge of that production process along. This is then followed up by in-person demonstrations, with group members being able to learn from each other, so that an improvement in practice in one firm can be observed and mimicked by others in the group.

"The Child Development Grant Programme (CGDP) will pilot a cash transfer programme that will focus on removing the food security and financial barriers to improving nutrition. The programme will operate in rural areas of two states in Nigeria: Jigawa and Zamfara.,By providing cash to poor women, it is expected that the programme will enable them to buy more and better quality food and also to spend money on education and health. The project, which will be implemented by Save the Children (SC) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) will provide a child development grant (CDG) of approximately 3,500 Naira (£14) a month to mothers, from the time they are confirmed to be pregnant until the child is two years old.,The design of the evaluation is such that there will be a control group, a first treatment group of mothers that receive the unconditional cash grant plus basic, ""low intensity"" nutritional education and advice to mothers, and in another treatment arm this unconditional cash transfer will be supplemented by the provision of ""high intensity"" nutritional education and advice to mothers.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000454,National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria,2014-06-30,,"July 30, 2014",,,,,,,,,NHREC/01/01/2007-30/06/2014c
"This project has three experimental arms, which feature different combinations of two information sharing products designed specifically for migrant workers. ,The first product is a paper-based placement agency “report card”.  The report card will rank the most-frequently used placement agencies in the area and will include the name of the placement agency, the number of reviews from migrants, and an overall score, with an associated smiley face graphic to indicate overall quality. The report cards will also include contact information for the placement agencies.,The second product will take the form of a short comic book. The goal of the comic book is to help communicate in an accessible manner the fact that placement agency quality, and not just fate, matters in affecting migration outcomes. (Pilot research indicated that many migrants did not believe agency quality was important for their overall migration outcome. Thus, one reason migrants may not attend to available information about agency quality is that they do not think it is important). The comic will explain why agency quality matters through the story of a fictional migrant worker – here, the emphasis will be on relatable characters and simple, clear language. ,Both of these products will be disseminated to potential migrant workers through village-level discussion sessions.,The experimental arms include (a) report card only, (b) comic book only, (c) report card and comic book.

"The proposed intervention is the introduction of full time, affordable daycare centers, or balwadis, that will be implemented by Seva Mandir, in 80 hamlets in the Udaipur district of Rajasthan. These hamlets will serve as the treatment group for the randomized control trial. Each of the balwadis will provide childcare, nutritious food and supplements, basic medicines, and preschool education to children 1-6 years old. Balwadis are operated by local women, called Sanchalikas, who meet with mothers on a quarterly basis to discuss their child's progress. They also promote immunization of children by maintaining immunization records and following-up with parents and government nurses. ,In December 2014 and early January 2015, potential study hamlets were selected. These hamlets were selected from areas where Seva Mandir works and operates programs besides the balwadi program. We identified 160 eligible hamlets that satisfied five criteria, specifically: (1) no readily accessible balwadi or government-run aganwadi nearby (within 1.5 kilometers) to reduce the potential for contamination effects; (2) minimum number of children in the appropriate age range (>24) in the village to ensure adequate demand; (3) existing building suitable for a balwadi; (4) a qualified Sanchalika, living in the study hamlet or nearby, to operate the balwadi; and (5) adequate demand from the village council (Panchayat) for a new balwadi, as expressed by an application for a balwadi. Seva Mandir provided a listing of 160 hamlets that satisfied these criteria to the study investigators, after which a household census was conducted in each hamlet to confirm the eligibility of the hamlet, enumerate the population, and identify potential households for inclusion.,In January 2015, we conducted a household census in each of the 160 hamlets to confirm the eligibility of the hamlet, enumerate the population, and identify potential respondents for inclusion. Eligible respondents were mothers (biological or guardian) with a child between one and six years of age. The total number of eligible respondents was similar to our desired sample size. Therefore, we did not probabilistically sample individuals among eligible respondents and all eligible respondents were selected for interview.,Within each eligible household, a woman with a child less than 6 years old was randomly selected as the primary respondent using a Kish procedure. Outcomes will be measured via in-person survey at baseline, just before the balwadis are introduced, at midline, approximately halfway through the intervention period, and at endline, approximately 18-24 months post the start of the intervention.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000774,"IFMR Human Subjects Committee,McGill Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board","2014-09-22,2014-09-08",,"July 15, 2015",,,,,,,,,"IRB00007107; FWA00014616; IORG0005894,FWA 00004545"
"The main aspect of the treatment to be randomized is whether the insurance offered by the partner contract farming company is paid for up front or on credit.. The insurance on credit is identical to the standard insurance, except the cost (plus interest at the standard rate for other inputs) is agreed to be borne as a deduction from the farmer's revenue after harvest. We will study the impact of offering the insurance through deduction and compare this effect to the effect of a large reduction (about 30%) in premium when paying upfront.,The insurance offered has a double trigger design. Payment occurs only if both farmer's individual yield is low and the local average yield is low.

"The primary goal of JEEViKA is to promote socio-economic inclusion of rural impoverished households by mobilizing women members from such families into SHGs (Self Help Groups). SHG members meet regularly to participate in savings, borrowing and repayments; additionally, the group provides an opportunity for 10-15 women of similar backgrounds to come together and discuss their day-to-day lives. Each member is required to deposit 10-20 cents weekly; once some equity is established, the members may begin drawing credit from this pool. After some weeks or months of demonstrated group savings, the project provides the SHG with a one-time grant of 900 USD, which the SHG may disburse as loans to its members. Going forward, the goal is to link SHGs to banks and leverage funds from formal credit institutions. The annual cost of credit to SHG members is 24%, a relatively low rate compared to those charged by existing informal creditors. Once a minimum number (10-15) of SHGs form in a village, they are federated into a Village Organization (VO).  The VO acts as a platform through which JEEViKA initiatives, such as linkages with NGO-led income generating projects or government programs, are communicated to SHG members. The VO also has a mandate to identify issues at the village level and liaise with the project’s staff to provide practical solutions.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000570,International Food Policy Research Institute Institutional Review Board,2015-03-17,,"April 24, 2015",,,,,,,,,2015-9-MTID-M

"We evaluate investments into equipment upgrades at Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) schools in Mongolia, a part of the Vocational Education Training Project sponsored by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and designed to address the gaps in Mongolia’s vocational education system. The project seeks to increase the wages of poor Mongolians by improving their technical skills and productivity to meet labor market demand in key industries (including, among others, construction, mining, electronics, mechanics, and transport). More than half of MCC’s investment into the Mongolian TVET sector was spent on upgrading equipment and constructing and rehabilitating workshops. The upgrades of 19 categories of equipment in the ten schools participating in this study were completed in August 2013, ultimately affecting 21 trades. ,We hypothesize that a school receiving the equipment upgrades will cause students in affected trades to be more likely to train with improved equipment. This experience with modern, relevant equipment will improve their factual understanding of the trade and familiarize the students with the tools used by employers. Employers should then find students more productive than they otherwise would, making it more likely that students will be able to find employment and increasing the wages that employers are willing to pay them.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000155,Human Subjects Committee for Innovations for Poverty Action,2010-08-06,,"March 30, 2015",,,,,,,,,183.10 August.-003
"In advanced peri-urban communities such as Accra, the market for sanitation services is already relatively well developed, but households continue to face difficulties in finding and hiring sanitation service providers.  As a result, households may not complete necessary desludgings as quickly as they would like, creating local health and sanitation concerns as they wait to have the desludgings completed.  In addition, households often hire middlemen to find desludging service providers who substantially increase costs for desludging.

"Workshop: The Foundational Training for Aspiring Young Politicians workshop will be held in Sorsogon City, the namesake capital of the Province of Sorsogon. It will be an all-expense-paid 3-day workshop. The workshop will be held in 4 batches. In 2 of these batches, the workshop will have a conditional incentive, while in the other 2 batches the workshop will have an unconditional incentive.,The workshop will be conducted by a hired consultant, Alvin Samson. The PI will also be present at all workshops to oversee the whole event. Alvin Samson will be assisted by the study team members that will serve as workshop facilitators. Subjects selected to attend the workshop will be asked to bring along with them signed assent to participate in the workshop and the parent's permission letter to participate in the workshop with their parent's signature. To ensure that the workshop runs smoothly and safely, we will ask the subject and the parent to read and agree to the house rules of the workshop.,Workshop Content: The workshop is entitled ""LEAD2SERVE SUMMIT: Foundational Training for Aspiring Young Politicians,"" which I am developing in close consultation with Alvin Samson, the main workshop facilitator. The Lead2Serve Summit provides aspiring young leaders (ages 15 to 17) a shared platform to interact with each other, to be grounded on leadership principles that found application both in the corporate and public sectors, and to evolve a plan of action that they can readily implement and deploy in their immediate community in the context of their prospective roles as elected youth council members.,The workshop is a combination of plenary sessions, individual activity and small group discussions, and structured learning exercises. (Please see attached workshop framework document in Docs & Materials tab). Workshop outputs are in the form of worksheets to be accomplished by participants in every individual activity and small group discussion.,Scoring: Participants will receive scores for their participation in each of the plenary sessions and for each of the worksheets that they accomplish and submit.,Scoring is simple. A participant will either receive a score of 1, 2, or 3 (3 being the highest score) for each of the following: Participation in Plenary 1, Participation in Plenary 2, Participation in Plenary 3, Worksheet 1, Worksheet 2, Worksheet 3, Worksheet 4,Participation in plenary sessions will be scored by the participant's Small Group Facilitator. Scores obtained in the three plenary sessions will then be averaged out. This average score from participation will carry a weight of 20% of the overall score. Worksheets will be scored anonymously. Every time worksheets are submitted, they will be randomly redistributed equally among the Small Group Facilitators. Worksheets will be redistributed for scoring twice, so that each worksheet will receive two scores from two different, randomly assigned Small Group Facilitators. The two scores will be averaged out.,Average score for worksheet 1 will carry a weight of 20% of the overall score.,Average score for worksheet 2 will carry a weight of 20% of the overall score.,Average score for worksheet 3 will carry a weight of 40% of the overall score.,Hence each participant will receive an overall score that would range between 1 and 3. (Please see attached workshop framework document in Docs & Materials tab).,Incentives: The workshop content will be the same across the 4 batches. This is because maintaining symmetry across the treatment groups is crucial for the science of the study. The only difference between workshops with conditional incentive and workshops with unconditional incentive is as follows:,In workshops with conditional incentive (Group B), participant output from and performance in the different workshop sessions will be assigned scores, although participants will not know during the workshop that performance is actually being monitored and scored to prevent Hawthorne effects (i.e., reactivity of respondents to knowing that they are being scored). A predetermined overall cutoff score will be set before any of the workshops. Participants that make the cutoff score will be,given an incentive at the end of the workshop during the closing ceremony. ,The incentive is a certificate of merit, and 5 pieces of campaign posters that the Angara Centre will donate to the respondent if he/she subsequently files for a certificate of candidacy. In workshops with unconditional incentive (Group C), participant output from and performance in the different workshop sessions will also be assigned scores, although participants will not know during the workshop that performance is actually being monitored and scored. However, these scores will have no bearing, since at the end of the workshop during the closing ceremony, each and all participants will be given the same incentive as described in the preceding paragraph. That is, everyone will receive a certificate of merit and--should they choose to subsequently file an official certificate of candidacy--5 pieces of campaign posters each from the Angara Centre. Hence, the two types of workshops are symmetric in all ways but one. The difference between the two sets of workshops is in the manner by which the incentive is earned by the participants. Whereas in Group B, earning the incentive is conditional on making the score cutoff, in Group C the incentive is unconditional and awarded to everyone in the group.,At the end of every workshop, all respondents receiving the incentive will be awarded the certificate of merit. They will also be asked to inform the study team by text message or email if they subsequently decide to file their official certificate of candidacies so that the study team can prepare the campaign posters to be donated to them in time for the campaign period. Respondents will also be informed at the end of every workshop that to verify their candidacy, the study team will collect copies of COCs, which is publicly available from COMELEC.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000358,University of Michigan Institutional Review Board,2013-08-16,,"May 05, 2014",,,,,,,,,HUM00074256

Note that although land may be collectively titled, a distinction must be made between farm ownership and management: most of the farms under these titles are farmed individually, not collectively.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000168,"University of Maryland, College Park",2013-11-18,,"December 16, 2013",,,,,,,,,488988-1
"There are two interventions that are part of this project; disseminating politician performance information to citizens, and allowing citizens to communicate complaints to politicians via innovative text messaging software.,The intensive dissemination consist in community meetings held by ACODE, our partner organization, at parish level. They invite the community leaders of the community and explain them the roles of the councilors and their scores. In addition, the information on councilors' responsibilities and scores is shared with meeting attendees throughout the year via periodic text-messages.,The text message platform allows citizens to send messages to their councilors regarding problems or issues in their subcounties. The service is introduced through a series of community meetings. Reminders of the system are sent to meeting attendees throughout the year via text messages.,The RCT is implemented using a 2x2 factorial design. ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000450,Innovations for Poverty Action IRB,2012-05-23,,"August 26, 2014",,,,,,,,,12May-005

"We design a phone marketing experiment in which we randomize the characteristics of the product being offered and the scripts used for the call.,First, some clients are offered to replace their non-premium card by a premium card, while others are offered all of the extra services of a premium card on their existing non-premium card. Customers will thus be offered the same instrumental services: the only thing differing is whether the services are included in their present relatively nondescript card, or on the premium platinum card which might have an additional ""status"" component. If the share accepting the premium card is higher than the share accepting the added benefits to the non-premium card, we will have established that customers value the status associated with the exclusive premium card. ,To further disentangle the nature of the demand for status -- social vs. self-image -- we proceed with additional treatments.,Some clients will be told that they were selected on the basis of their merit, while others will be told that they were chosen on the basis of luck. Both of these statements are true, since customers receiving these offers are randomly selected among those who qualify for the offer. The script mentioning merit should activate both social and self-image channels -- the opportunity to build self-image since the offer is an acknowledgment of the customer's financial success, and social image since the distinctive platinum card is well recognized by others as a marker of elite status. On the other hand, the luck script should activate only the social image aspect. If concerns about self-image are an important component of demand, the share of customers accepting the offers with the merit script should be higher than that with the luck script. A higher take up with the luck script indicates instead that self-image and social image might be substitutes: customers who received a positive shock to their self-image (being told they can have access to an exclusive good because of their economic success) are less concerned about social image considerations, and so have a lower demand for premium cards.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000828,UCLA Institutional Review Board,2015-06-30,,"September 13, 2015",,,,,,,,,IRB#15-000953

"Participants will be directed to a survey on Qualtrics.  In this survey, the participants will first be given a description of the mTurk task that was performed in the project registered as ""Response of Output to Varying Incentive Structures on Amazon Turk"".  Specifically, they will be shown the below text:,We ran a large, pre-registered experiment using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online marketplace where individuals around the world are paid to complete small tasks. The MTurk participants who completed our study are primarily from the United States (85%) or India (12%) and are well-educated (55% self report having a college degree). The gender and age breakdown of the participants closely mirrors the US population as a whole (54% female, 52% age 18-30, 39% age 31-50).   ,The MTurk participants in our study initially agreed to perform a simple task that takes 10 minutes in return for a fixed participation fee of $1.00. They were not given information about the task or about possible bonus money before agreeing to participate. As part of the experiment, they were offered different bonus payments to encourage them to perform well.,In bold below is the task exactly as it was described to the MTurk participants:,On the next page you will play a simple button-pressing task. The object of this task is to alternately press the 'a' and 'b' buttons on your keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 minutes. Every time you successfully press the 'a' and then the 'b' button, you will receive a point. Note that points will only be rewarded when you alternate button pushes: just pressing the 'a' or 'b' button without alternating between the two will not result in points.,Buttons must be pressed by hand only (key-bindings or automated button-pushing programs/scripts cannot be used) or the task will not be approved.,Feel free to score as many points as you can.,[The participant would then see a different final paragraph depending on the condition to which they were randomly assigned],The survey-takers will then be given the opportunity to participate in a practice button-pushing task to get a better sense of the actual task the MTurkers performed, and they will also be given the opportunity to view the instructions/walkthrough for that task in PDF format.  Having said this, the survey-takers are not obliged to participate in the practice task or look at said instructions. ,At this point, the aforementioned treatments will be displayed.  The actual average scores received by participants in the first three treatments are then listed in order to provide a reference point.  Participants are then asked to predict the number of points scored in the remaining treatments.  Their predictions are recorded using a draggable slider.,1.

"The Republic of Moldova has one of the highest documented levels of MDR-TB in the world (WHO, 2013) . The Ministry of Health has followed the WHO-recommended DOT (Directly Observed Treatment) during 2000-2004 and has used the Stop TB Strategy which includes DOT since 2006 (WHO, 2013). DOT is recommended by WHO as the best curative method for TB. Based on a small sample of patient interviews we think that for some patients DOT may be a hindrance rather than a help. The way that DOT is currently implemented in Moldova means that patients have to visit a doctor or nurse every day in order to be observed taking treatment. This is time consuming, can cost patients money, and adds a significant friction cost for patients. The alternative, for DOTs to be administered at home by roving personnel, is resource intensive and currently only available to a small number of patients in Moldova. VOT differs from DOT in that the daily observation of patients taking their medication will be observed via internet video calling rather than in-person. This should save patients a huge amount of time and money. Given the prevalence of side effects of medication, being able to take medication at home may also increase patient wellbeing.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000579,University College London,2014-11-27,,"December 12, 2014",,,,,,,,,2220/001
"Patient population:,	This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot study was conducted between June 2010 and July 2013. The protocol was approved by local ethics committee of the institution. Each subject signed an informed consent to participate in this trial.,	 During this period, 76 women complaining of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) for > 6 months and defined as a pain score > VAS 50mm (visual analogue scale) were enrolled. Eligible patients had laparoscopically confirmed pelvic endometriosis (stage I-IV) and patent fallopian tubes. The exclusion criteria were age <18 years, any hormonal therapy in preceding 3 months, a desire to conceive within 1 year, or occluded fallopian tubes with or without pelvic adhesions. Cases with proved non-gynecologic causes of CPP (intestinal, urinary, and/or musculoskletal) were also excluded from the study. Each patient was advised to stop any analgesic medications before enrollment into the study. Patients with a known hypersensitivity or any contraindications to bupivacaine or to any local anesthetic agent of the amide-type were also excluded from the study.,	 All women in this trial underwent complete pelvic examination and high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography. Basic work-up investigations to exclude concomitant non-gynecologic causes of CPP including mid-stream urine analysis, stool analysis, intravenous urogram, and full blood count whenever indicated were done. Only subjects with purely diagnosed pelvic endometriosis and patent fallopian tubes were included in this study.,Randomization:,	At the time of office recruitment, patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 that was performed in accordance with a computer-generated randomization sequence using numbered, sealed envelopes to have either pertubal hysteroscopic-guided diluted bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion [Single-dose vial 10 ml + 100 ml Ringer solution] (group I, n=30) or placebo infusion [100 ml Ringer solution alone] (group II, n=30). All patients and experimenters (while delivering treatment, scanning and analyzing data) were blinded to the type of treatment.,	The allocated study solution was provided to the surgeon intraoperatively by senior nursing staff. Solutions were indistinguishable and were preloaded into identical unlabeled Ringer solution bottles. ,Pertubal infusion method:,	The procedure was carried-out in a day-case endoscopic suite. One treatment setting was to be given preovulatory on cycle Day 7-12. Under paracervical block, and using Ringer solution as a uterine distending medium (Hysteromat, Karl Storz, Germany), an office hysteroscope (2.7 mm, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was passed and one tubal orifice was identified. Under a hysteroscopic guidance, a 3-Fr ureteric catheter was introduced, cannulated through the tubal ostium and passed proximally for 2-3 cm. After successful cannulation, diluted bupivacaine (0.25%, 10 ml with Ringer solution 100 ml) [Marcaine, AstraZenica, Istanbul, Turkey] was then infused through the catheter over a 15-20 min period. None of the patients used any adjunctive measures or analgesics following the original treatment. ,Follow-up:,Follow-up visits after hysteroscopic pertubal infusion were scheduled after 1, 2, and 3 months. A month before each visit, the patients completed a diary of their pain score. These were collected at the follow-up visit and new diaries given for the next visit. Grading of symptoms and physical findings were assessed at each clinic visit. The duration of treatment was completed in 3 months. Each patient was advised to stop any analgesic medications and to use barrier contraception throughout the study.,Outcome measures:,	For the month preceding the trial, each patient completed a diary for generation of baseline variables, which were used for the assessment of the response to treatment. Response to treatment was assessed subjectively by changes in the variables, which included the patient's perception of pelvic pain severity using a visual analogue scale (VAS), her rating of both types of pelvic pain (dysmenorrheal and/or non-cycling pain) on a daily verbal rating scale (VRS), and a monthly verbal pelvic pain score (VRSmonthly). Satisfaction rates were also assessed. ,Measurement tool:,The VAS was a subjective assessment of the pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain). It was recorded on a 10cm ruler in the diary at each follow-up visit and reflected the severity of this symptom as perceived by the patient in the preceding month (daily VAS). A monthly score (VRSmonthly) was then generated from the summation of daily VAS over a 28-day period (0, no pain; 100, maximum pain) at 1, 2, and 3 months., On a multiple-choice questionnaire, an overall patient satisfaction rate that was independent of age, duration or severity of the symptoms was used to assess performance and satisfaction (satisfied, uncertain, dissatisfied) in daily activities at the end of the study taking into account the undesirable side effects. ,Sample size justification:,	Sample size was calculated using Epi Info® version 6.0, setting the type- I error (α) at 0.05 and the power (1- β) at 0.8, data from previous studies (5-7). According to these values and at 95% confidence interval, a minimal sample size of 60 patients was accepted to reach statistically accepted figure. Therefore, a total number of 76 patients were recruited in this study. ,Data collection and statistical analysis:,Data concerning subjects who had undergone the office procedure since June 2010 were collected prospectively. The case notes of those with  minimum of 3-months follow-up were further reviewed for the purposes of this report.,	Epi Info® version 6.0 was used to record and statistically analyse the data. Values at the time of the hysteroscopic-guided pertubal bupivacaine infusion (i.e time 0) were compared with those at three time points (1, 2 and 3 months) after infusion using the paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoson and Friedman two-way ANOVA tests as appropriate. A level of significance of P<.05 was accepted for the study.   ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000573,Mansoura University Research Committee,2010-05-31,,"December 10, 2014",,,,,,,,,433

"The research design consists of three main interventions:,1.	In the basic intervention (literacy), adults will participate in an education course for ten months over two years, during which time they will learn reading, writing, and math skills in their primary indigenous language (Hausa). The course will follow the Ministry of Non-Formal Education’s (MNFE’s) adult education curriculum, which first provides basic literacy and numeracy training, and then thematic training in agriculture and health.  Each village will have two classes separated by gender which will be taught by a local literacy teacher.  Literacy participants will be randomly chosen from among all eligible (i.e. illiterate) individuals in the village. ,2.

However, unlike the earlier intervention, literacy participants will not be provided with a shared mobile phone (mobile phone ownership is around 50 percent).  This decision is partly a response to the pilot phase (when few of the shared mobile phones were used) and partly a strategy to increase the cost-effectiveness and scale of the program for the MNFE, which would not be able to distribute mobile phones in this context.  ,3.	The third intervention (ABC2) will provide adult learners with educational content via the mobile phone, in particular sending SMS that reinforce the concepts learned in class. The SMS will vary in terms of frequency, type of information provided (i.e., a reminder or detailed technical information) and intensity (i.e., number of students).  ,Finally, a subset of villages above will be randomly assigned to a mobile phone monitoring intervention, to better understand how monitoring affects moral hazard of teachers' performance.  ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000476,Tufts University Medford Campus,2014-01-28,,"August 07, 2014",,,,,,,,,1312027
"READY4K! is an eight-month long text messaging program for parents of four year olds designed to help them support their children’s literacy development. It draws on research on literacy development (e.g., Lonigan & Shanahan, 2009), parenting practices (e.g., Reese, Sparks & Leyva, 2010), and behavior change strategies (e.g., Abraham & Michie, 2008). The program is linked to the California Preschool Learning Foundations and is structured as a spiral curriculum – it starts simple and gets progressively more advanced over time, and topics are re-introduced throughout the year for reinforcement. For example, the first week of the program focuses on parent-child conversations, while the last few weeks concentrate on developing high quality parent-child book reading routines (see Appendix A for a description of the text development process). READY4K! is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese.,In the present study, parents who were randomly assigned to the treatment group received three READY4K! texts messages each week during the school year about a particular early literacy skill or set of skills (starting in October and ending in May). On Mondays, they received “FACT” texts, designed to generate buy in by highlighting the importance of a particular skill or set of skills. On Wednesdays, they received “TIP” texts, designed to maximize parents’ self-efficacy in supporting their children’s literacy development by minimizing the costs associated with adopting beneficial practices. These texts include short, simple, and highly-specific activities for parents to do with their children. On Fridays, parents received “GROWTH” texts, which provide encouragement and reinforcement and extend the tips from Wednesdays. The following example week of texts focuses on beginning sound awareness:,FACT: Beginning word sounds are essential for reading. You can help your child learn to read by saying the beginning sound of words. “Read” starts w/ “rrr.”  ,TIP: Say two words to your child that start with the same sound, like happy & healthy. Ask: can you hear the “hhh” sound in happy & healthy?   ,GROWTH: By saying beginning word sounds, like “ttt” in taco & tomato, you’re preparing your child 4K. Now, have your child make the “ttt” sound.  ,Overall, READY4K! covers a wide range of early literacy skills and related parenting practices, including: alphabet knowledge, letter sounds, beginning sound awareness, rhyme awareness, nursery rhyme awareness, name writing, concepts of print, story comprehension, vocabulary development, elaborative reminiscing, parent-child conversations, listening to and singing songs, and establishing high-quality parent-child book reading routines. ,Throughout the program, text messages emphasized parental involvement at the school. The following text, which we sent during a week about concepts of print, is one example of how we addressed parental involvement: ,TIP: Ask the teacher about your child’s knowledge of concepts of print. Concepts of print include knowing how book are organized & that words have meaning.  ,We also included messages about SFUSD’s Raising A Reader (RAR) program, which regularly sends books home to children in both the treatment and control group. In particular, we coupled reading activity texts with texts about RAR. We worried that families without their children’s books would not uptake suggested reading activities. Highlighting the district’s book program was one way to address this concern:,TIP: Use the RAR red book bag to build your routine. Let your child hold the book. Ask what it is about. Follow the words with your finger as your read.,To the extent possible, READY4K! texts build on activities that parents already do with their children. By adding to pre-existing family routines, the program’s messages further reduce the costs of adopting good home literacy practices – parents do not have to take up a new activity they just have to make the most of something that they already do with their children. For example, the following “spiral” week of texts – which covers a wide range of early literacy skills including answering open-ended questions, concepts of print, letter identification, letters sounds, and vocabulary building – focuses on making the most of bath time:,FACT: Bath time is great for teaching your child important skills for K. Start by asking your child: what are the things we need for bath time? Why? ,TIP: When you’re bathing your child, point out the letters on the shampoo bottles. Ask your child to name them & tell you the sounds that they make. ,GROWTH: By teaching at bath time, you’re preparing your child for K. Next time, ask questions about body parts. Where are your elbows? What do they do? ,While parents in the treatment group received multiple READY4K! texts per week, parents in the control group received one placebo text about every two weeks during the 2013-14 school year. These messages generally pertained to the district’s kindergarten enrollment requirements or required vaccinations. Here are two examples:,READY4K: Students new to SFUSD are required to have a TB Skin Test. Children entering K need: 5 DTaP, 4 Polio, 3 Hepatitis B, 2 MMR and 1 Varicella vaccines.,READY4K: Immunization forms are available at any San Francisco Health Center & SFUSD’s Educational Placement Center at 555 Franklin St., Room 100.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000536,Stanford University Institutional Review Board,2012-09-21,,"October 28, 2014",,,,,,,,,Protocol ID #25613

"Individuals who are more able and self-motivated enough to enroll in financial literacy training are also more likely to make sound financial choices. There is an obvious selection bias if those with high levels of financial literacy are different than those with low levels of financial literacy. OLS estimates of the effect of financial literacy on financial decisions and outcomes would be biased as we might end up attributing differences in savings levels to unobserved differences rather than financial literacy. For instance, Meier & Sprenger (2008) show that individual time preference may explain who chooses to become financially literate. At the same time, discount rates are an important determinant of individual saving patterns as a person with a high discount rate would place lower value on future rewards. If we do not control for this unobserved heterogeneity in time preferences across individuals, we will get biased estimates.,In order to establish a causal effect, our study uses random assignment of transnational households to financial literacy training. We seek to evaluate the effect of a financial literacy program and access to financial services.,Filipino overseas workers and their families are our target population. The Philippines is the second largest migrant-sending country and the third largest remittance receiving country in the world.

"In the intervention arm 15-16 year old students were given information on variation in graduate salaries in England.  The students were told to assume that they were leaving school with at least the qualifications regarded as necessary for admission to university in England. Students were divided randomly into two groups. One group were told they would be making decisions as males (and given data for males) and one group were told they would be making decisions as females (and given information for females).The information was provided through an activity in which students were asked to choose between successive pairs of options.The information provided was based on the data on graduate salaries provided in O'Leary and Sloane (2011) scaled up to match evidence of average graduate salaries for a thirty year-old at the time when the intervention was conducted. The first choice for students was between not going to university or going to university to study Art. Students were then told the salaries for each. They were then given an option to switch from whatever they had chosen in this round to studying a History degree. In successive rounds they were given options to switch to other subjects including Mathematics, Science, Engineering and Languages. This activity was followed by two more which presented the same data in different formats and posed questions to the students which they answered in pairs or on their own.

"AGEP is being implemented will be randomly assigned one of three different versions of the intervention: (1) the full program (safe spaces, savings accounts, and health vouchers), (2) safe spaces with a health voucher, or (3) safe spaces only. ,The core of the safe spaces component, implemented in partnership with YWCA Zambia, is a weekly girls’ group meeting in which 20 to 30 girls get together with a mentor—a young woman from their community—for short training sessions on a variety of topics as well as a chance to discuss the events of the past week. These ongoing, stable group sessions serve two critical functions: 1) they build a platform in which girls meet and can be reached with a variety of interventions and educational topics, and 2) they build social assets, including friendships, trusting relationships, and self-esteem, that have a positive influence on other dimensions of their lives—their livelihood and health. The safe spaces meetings have become an integral part of what girls expect in their lives and can be sustained in the long term via cultural change. ,The safe spaces groups are structured in two age cohorts, 10–14 and 15–19, with additional groups for married girls, in order to reach girls with the appropriate programming across the course of adolescence. During their weekly group meetings, girls are trained on a range of health and financial topics, and they have time to simply talk and build strong relationships with other girls in their community.,The Population Council worked in partnership with the National Savings and Credit Bank (NatSave) and Making Cents International to develop the Girls Dream Savings Account that AGEP participants are able to open. The NatSave account has a very low minimum opening balance, and any amount can be deposited or withdrawn with no fee. While girls are able to make deposits on their own, in order to adapt to the Zambian legal minimum age of 18 for opening accounts, girls select a cosignatory—a woman aged 18 or older—to assist with account opening and withdrawals. This financial mentor can be the girl’s mother, however the participant has the option to choose another female in her life who she trusts (i.e., older sister, teacher, aunt, neighbor).,In partnership with the Ministry of Community Development, Mother Child Health (MCDMCH) and InSTEDD, the Council is developing an e-Health Voucher that AGEP participants can redeem for a package of health services at contracted public and private health providers. The services covered by the voucher include basic wellness exams as well as age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. Service providers use text messages to interact with a web-based system that logs and issues authorization for the services in real-time. The Council trains providers at participating clinics in the provision of adolescent-friendly health services and conducts ongoing monitoring and quality-assurance visits at participating clinics. Providers are reimbursed per service provided based on pre-approved rates.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000983,"University of Zambia, Biomedical Research Ethics Committee,Population Council Institutional Review Board","2013-04-12,2012-01-15",,"December 16, 2015",,,,,,,,,"002-12-12,581"
"We work together with the management and the head production engineers in several Bangladeshi garment factories to implement the intervention. Participation in the project is still advertised, therefore the exact number of factories in the project is not yet determined. The intervention is of the following nature: Whenever a sewing line in the factory starts producing a new garment that it had not produced before but that was already produced on another sewing line, than the supervisor of the line that already produced the garment is actively involved in setting up the new line for producing the same garment. Sewing lines in our Bangladeshi partner factories typically switch the garment they produce every 1-3 weeks, and it is very common to see garments being produced on more than one line, while usually starting on different days. Switching the garment typically requires both changes of the machines used and/or adjustments on the machines themselves, such as change of the needle type or yarn type. The workers on the lines also need to be explained the new operations they have to perform on the new garment. This process of the style change can take between 1 hour and 1 day (but is usually done in the `zero-feeding' process, that is, in the line, one machine after another machines is adjusted, and the machines not yet adjusted still produce for the old garment while those already adjusted already work on the new garment. Thus, on average, each machine is idle only 15-30 minutes). ,In the randomly selected lines, whenever they switch to a garment that has already been produced on another line in the factory, the line supervisor from the earlier line should be actively involved in the described change process. He should brief the new line supervisor on the most important things he has learned while producing the garment on his line, and inspect the line changing process, either after the end of the line changing process or while the most important machines for the production of the new garment are set up. ,To monitor the intervention, we left with the factories either a tablet or a book, in which they should fill out a short survey every time a style change on a treatment line was ""treated"". The survey asks about the line that starts the garment and the line that already produced it, involved line supervisors, the garment itself, and a few questions on how well the communication went as perceived by the superiors of the line supervisors that instructed the briefing. The tablets send each report directly to a server upon finishing, while the books are collected regularly. Thus, the extent of the implementation, and whether it was implemented in the correct lines, can be checked throughout the experiment is running.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000495,University of Warwick,2014-03-06,,"August 29, 2014",,,,,,,,,-

"Many social scientists and policy makers express concern over low levels of college completion and poor overall academic performance. One explanation, drawing on recent insights from behavioral science, suggests that youth often overemphasize the present or rely too much on routine.

"In January 2007, the government of Nicaragua initiated a pilot program that extended the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute’s (INSS’s) health insurance program, which was previously only for formal sector employees, to informal sector workers. The coverage and cost of the program were designed to be as similar as possible to those associated with the program for workers employed in the formal sector. For a flat monthly fee, individuals in the informal sector gained access to a wide range of services with zero co-payment. The cost of the program was structured such that the monthly fee was higher in the first two months, at approximately US$18 per month, and then fell to approximately US$15 per month in subsequent months. The health insurance covered enrolled individuals and dependents under the age of twelve.,This evaluation attempted to measure the determinants of insurance enrollment as well as the impacts of having insurance for informal sector workers by randomly varying the costs and convenience of signing up for INSS health insurance. Individuals were assigned to purchase the insurance at either the INSS central office or the branch office of three participating MFIs: ACODEP, Banco ProCredit, and Findesa.,Between March and June 2007, a few months after the INSS insurance program was rolled out to informal sector workers, a baseline survey was administered to a representative sample of vendors in the three largest open-air markets in central Managua. At the end of the baseline survey, respondents were invited to choose a lottery ticket out of a stack of unmarked, pre-sealed envelopes. The possible lottery prizes included a blank ticket (no prize); an INSS brochure detailing the insurance product; a brochure accompanied by a 6-month insurance subsidy with instructions to sign up at the INSS office; or a brochure accompanied by a 6-month insurance subsidy with instructions to sign up at an MFI office. The 6-month subsidy was worth approximately US$96 and was provided in the form of a voucher; respondents were told that payments would be made on their behalf directly to the INSS. After one year, respondents were then approached for a follow-up survey to measure changes in health and healthcare utilization.",,,Yes,"2807 individuals approached, while 2610 (93%) completed the follow-up survey",No,"Health Econ. 19: 181–206 (2010)

Costs of the premiums as well as enrollment location were randomly allocated. Overall, take-up of the program was low, with only 20% enrollment. Program costs and streamlined bureaucratic procedures were important determinants of enrollment. Participation of local microfinance institutions had a slight negative effect on enrollment. One year later, those who received insurance substituted toward services at covered facilities and total out-of-pocket expenditures fell. However, total expenditures fell by less than the insurance premiums. We find no evidence of an increase in health-care utilization among the newly insured. We also find very low retention rates after the expiration of the subsidy, with less than 10% of enrollees still enrolled after one year. To shed light on the findings from the experimental results, we present qualitative evidence of institutional and contextual factors that limited the success of this program.

"FINO, a business and technology platform catering to “last mile” customers through Business Correspondent Agents (BCAs), has a bundled product linking a No-Frills Savings Account to a beneficiary’s EBT account. This product could indeed offer a powerful tool in expanding effective access to finance, as it combines an easily accessible savings vehicle with frequent interactions with the formal banking system. However, this product alone does not address the issue of low average financial capability of low-income populations, and it is probable that one would see the history of dormancy of NFAs repeat itself with no intervention being targeted at encouraging usage of financial products. ,Motivated by other successful examples we will therefore encourage customers holding an EBT-NFA account to divert some benefits payments to build savings and become more “financially active”. While this will still be done through financial literacy campaigns and incentives schemes, we intend to contribute to the financial capability space by addressing some of the major constraints of typical interventions, namely their high cost and low long-run effects, by studying the efficiency of two innovations: (1) training and incentivizing BCAs, and (2) providing financial information via mobile phone. ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000969,Harvard University- Committee On the Use of Human Subjects in Research,2013-10-21,,"December 16, 2015",,,,No,,,,,IRB13-2146

"This project involves three experimental sites: community colleges located within Ohio, Illinois, and Arizona. At each site, the intervention involves changes in the presentation of federal Stafford Loan offers. Students in the control group at each site will be presented with loan offers according to each institution's existing practices. This intervention will not affect students’ access to loans; in all cases students will be completely free to opt in, opt out, or change their loan amount in accordance with the rules of the student loan program. Additionally, upon completing an application for federal student aid – a prerequisite for receiving federal student aid – students are notified by the US Department of Education of their eligibility for federal loans. Thus, all students in our study will also be informed of their loan eligibility.,At the Ohio site, dependent students in the control group will receive a financial aid award letter listing a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans (determined by student need) equal to $3500 (first-year students) or $4500 (second-year students). Independent students in the control group will receive a financial aid award letter listing the above loan amount and an additional $4000 in unsubsidized loan aid, Students assigned to the treatment group will be presented with a loan amount of zero regardless of student level or dependency status.,At the Illinois site, students in the control will be presented with a loan amount of zero on their financial aid award letters, while students in the treatment group will receive an award letter listing the maximum subsidized federal loan they are eligible for. ,The Arizona site will involve two treatment arms. This institution uses an online system that asks students whether they want to borrow before displaying the financial aid package. Students who select “No” are then shown a financial aid package with $0 in federal loan aid. For those who select “Yes,” the institution lists a “base loan amount”. The first treatment arm will include a blank field next to the line on the award package for loan aid that the student will be prompted to fill in with his or her preferred loan amount (including $0). The second treatment arm will feature a blank loan offer as well, but it will also prompt students to complete a short budgeting worksheet prior to choosing a loan amount. Students in the control group who select ""yes"" when asked if they would like to borrow will be randomly assigned to receive an award package with a base amount that is randomized between 50% and 150% of the current amounts (i.e., $1,000 or $3,000/year for dependent students and $2,000 or $4,000/year for independent students).

"Sucre is one of four municipalities of Venezuelan capital city, Caracas. Roughly 1 million people live there. According to the latest data available, 80% of homicides in Sucre occur in 6% of its street segments. Using geo-referenced homicide data, we identified 113 hotspots in July 2013: street segments with at least two homicides in 2012 and that met one of the following criteria: ,•	Always hot (45): segments that were among the 160 deadliest segments in each of the previous three years.,•	Heating (8): segments among the 160 deadliest in t (June 2012 – June 2013), but not in t-1 (June 2011 – June 2012), with at least 1 homicide in t-1.,•	Cooling (36): segments among the 160 deadliest in t-1, but not in t, with some homicides in t.,•	Newly hot (23): segments among the 100 deadliest in t, but that could not be included in any of the other three categories and with at least two homicides in t.,Field visits to the identified segments with the local patrol police led to a definition of 92 relevant “intervention areas”, or policy –hotspots, mostly as a result of two hot street segments being too close to one another to represent separate hotspots, or corners where it made sense to park a patrol car and from where two hot segments were in straight line of sight. 46 spots were randomly assigned to treatment and  46 to control (see below). Two months into the implementation of the program, there were significant compliance problems (police were not delivering the required dosage) so the number of treatment hotspots was reduced to 34.,Police patrols are expected to make visits using an unpredictable pattern. Also, during each visit, police are expected to stop and search, to guard and to build cooperative relationships with the community.,Police patrols were equipped with GPS so that their movements can be monitored. A geofence around each hotspot helped precisely clock the time of entry and exit to each hotspot. Reports on police compliance are produced three times a day and sent to the patrol supervisors, and a weekly report on the implementation of the program is sent to the supervising authorities. In order to get police personnel to conform with these protocols, the administrators established a system of incentives consisting of in-kind payments to the 20 officers with the best performance. Specifically, performance is being evaluated along a number of dimensions: compliance with time and number of visits to the hotspots, variability in the hours at which visits occur and that their GPS equipment has not been tampered with or damaged",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000469,,,,"August 08, 2014",,,,,,,,,

"The objective of the project was to assess the impact of various forms of packaging and messages associated with the ACT drugs on adherence to the treatment regimen. To evaluate this, we randomized the type of packaging/messages individuals received each time they came to the participating shops to purchase ACTs.,The control package in this study was the standard package in which ACTs (specifically Artemether Lumefantrine, brand name Lumartem) were sold in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa. The box had the name, brand and manufacturer of the medication. Inside the box was a blister pack which grouped the pills by dose and day and a paper insert, similar to what is seen inside most medication boxes in the U.S. and elsewhere, which have small print with details about dosing, side effects, etc. ,The first treatment arm tested the status quo approach to promoting adherence through specialized packaging. It was known as the ""CAPSS"" package because it was used in Uganda during the Consortium for ACT Private Sector Subsidy pilot program (run by the Uganda MOH, Medicines for Malaria Venture, Population Services International and others).  The CAPSS packaging served as a form of branding and quality assurance, and it was also designed to encourage correct use of the product, incorporating features like colorful pictorial instructions on how to take the medicine, principally to assist illiterate patients and caregivers in taking the medication correctly.,The second treatment arm was designed to test, if the CAPSS packaging was successful at boosting adherence rates, whether the improvement was due mostly to the information and pictorial instructions or whether it was also linked to the product quality and differentiation conveyed by the special, glossy packaging. We created a handout to be distributed with the ACTs that was a simple photocopy of the CAPSS package and wrapped it around the control package when distributing the medication at the drug shop ,Two additional treatment arms were designed to test whether simple messages delivered via stickers attached to the control packaging could also promote adherence. The first sticker was designed to address non-adherence based on the belief that the illness is cured when symptoms have improved or resolved. It said ""Malaria is NOT gone until ALL tablets are finished"". The second sticker message aimed to discourage the saving of pills for the next malaria episode and internalize the externality associated with non-adherence. It said ""Finish ALL tablets. Saving tablets for later can be harmful for malaria control in your community."" ,An additional treatment arm was also included in the study with a sticker that provided the actual (non-subsidized) price of the medicines. However, due to budgetary reasons, this treatment had to be phased out before we obtained a reasonable sample size. ,The final treatment was a random (cross-cutting) offer to patients of a free rapid diagnosis test to test for malaria. ",,Yes,Yes,9 drug shops,Yes,,No,AEARCTR-0000490,"Uganda National Council for Science and Technology,Harvard School of Public Health Office of Human Research Administration","2010-09-29,2010-09-07","September 26, 2011 12:00 AM +00:00","September 03, 2014",,"Control: 699, CAPSS Pack: 465, CAPSS - Information Only: 392, Message 1 (""Malaria is not gone...etc""): 394, Message 2 (""Finish all your medication...etc""): 434, Message 3 (Actual, unsubsidized price of ACT on Sticker): 133",No,Yes,,"August 18, 2011, 12:00 AM +00:00","2,517 ACT Purchases",,"HS-832,19527-101"

"The intervention is a Depot Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (DMPA) evidence-based medicine program consisting of a two-hour roundtable seminar and two educational visits that would reinforce messages from the seminar. Programmers invited treatment group providers to the DMPA roundtable seminar led by trained private peer providers who presented clinical research findings related to DMPA. The roundtable format of the seminar allowed providers to discuss these findings within the local context, with the overall goal of correcting misconceptions and biases and improving providers' knowledge of evidence-based health benefits of method use. The seminar covered findings on fertility return, anemia, amenorrhea, and other real or perceived side effects of DMPA. The two educational visits, to be scheduled ahead of time with individual doctors, were conducted by a trained health worker. These 15-minute one-on-one sessions, held in individual providers' clinics, were intended to review specific information that was discussed during the seminar. These sessions had three objectives: to enhance the availability of evidence to support providers in counseling about DMPA; to address concerns about its side effects and perceived harm (such as delays in returns to fertility); and to convey information about its potential benefits (such as protective effects against cancer). The seminar and educational visits were implemented between January and June 2012. ,The control group providers were not invited to a DMPA seminar and were not offered educational visits related to DMPA. However, in order to continue to engage the control group providers during the period of the study (the first six months of 2012), they were offered two repeat educational visits during this same time period; these visits were related to Combined Oral Contraception (COC) pills and a repeat of the previous year's materials. Thus, the treatment and control groups differed in the content as well as the extent of program offerings: the treatment group was offered participation in the DMPA seminar and two DMPA educational visits, and the control group was offered two repeat educational visits on COCs. No information about DMPA was discussed during the COC visits; thus, any detectable differences on knowledge, attitudes, or practice related to DMPA can be attributed to the influence of the DMPA program. ",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000539,"Abt Associates Inc., Institutional Review Board",2012-01-01,,"November 03, 2014",,,,,,,,,0600

Information treatment,A random subset of poll respondents will receive detailed information about the natural gas discovery, and the pros and cons of various gas policy options.  The information will be provided in the form of a roughly thirty-minute video, screened in the field by survey teams after the baseline poll. The video aims to provide a balanced view of controversial alternatives, and is based on a script written with input and approval from a panel of researchers, Tanzanian industry representatives, civil society leaders, and politicians spanning all three major political parties as well as relevant government agencies. ,2. Deliberation treatment,A randomly drawn subset of individuals receiving the information treatment will be invited to a national deliberative event.  The event will be held over two days in April 2015, in Dar es Salaam, with travel and accommodation provided by the project. At the event, poll respondents will participate in small group deliberations about specific gas policy options, followed by question and answer sessions with experts.

"Our University of Chicago Crime Lab research team will carry out a 2 x 2 randomized experiment, in which some male youth are randomly assigned to receive what we believe to be best-practice intensive academic supports (high-dosage math tutoring provided by Match Education of Boston), or what we believe to be best-practice non-academic supports, for which we have identified Youth Guidance's Becoming a Man (BAM) program that provides a version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or to receive both, or neither (control condition).,At the time the program is being launched, our research team has resources to provide intervention services to youth for one year (AY 2013-14). Our team is currently seeking additional funding to be able to provide youth randomized into different treatment and control conditions with 2 years of intervention.,The BAM intervention is a version of CBT adapted to help promote pro-social life outcomes among disadvantaged male youth. BAM includes in-school and after-school programming designed to reduce overly-automatic behavior that can lead to problem outcomes, encourage youth to reflect on their decision-making heuristics, or promote meta-cognition (to ""think about thinking""). By helping youth learn and practice new ways to manage their emotional responses to difficult situations through stories, role-playing, small group exercises, and homework, the program encourages what psychologists call ""cognitive restructuring,"" designed to generate lasting gains in youths' behaviors. BAM is a program of Youth Guidance (YG), a Chicago-area non-profit that has been serving Chicago children for 87 years, and currently provides services to 14,000 at-risk students across more than 70 schools through a partnership with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) that dates back more than four decades. YG will implement the BAM intervention beginning in the 2013-14 academic year in some of the most distressed schools in Chicago's south and west sides.,The Match Tutors program expands on the nationally recognized innovation of high-dosage, in-school-day tutoring developed in the three Match Charter Public Schools in Boston. Tutoring is embedded into the school day as an elective class, as a supplement to the regular classroom math teacher. Every student works with a full-time, professional tutor in addition to their other classes, so that the class offered by Match Tutors will be given for credit, not as a pull-out or afterschool intervention As a regular part of their school day, students will attend tutoring for 50 minutes a day, 5 days a week. The tutoring course, entitled Mathematics Lab, has been granted credit-bearing status by CPS and will be offered each semester within a school year so that students will earn one elective credit upon completion of the course. Math Lab offers a standards-based curriculum that is individualized to each student's needs with the goal of complementing the work done in math classes - preparing students for city and state math assessments, enabling them to pass math class finals, and helping students build skills and habits of learning that will help them succeed in school and beyond.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000041,Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of Chicago,2013-06-24,,"September 12, 2014",,,,,,,,,N/A

"All study respondents first participated in a household paper survey, which covered questions on household characteristics, farm plot characteristics, social networks and agricultural practices.  Following this, treatment farmers were provided access to a toll-free agricultural helpline. Farmers received weekly voice push messages through this service, and could also use this helpline to record agricultural questions, listen and respond to agricultural questions of other farmers and to share their agricultural experiences. The farmer did not have to bear any cost for listening to the weekly messages or calling in to the AO line.,Additionally, a smaller subset of farmers received complementary traditional agricultural extension services, which includes field visits and demonstrations by agronomists. Following the start of the intervention, all respondents participated in monthly phone surveys and two more paper surveys – mid-trial (in July 2012) and towards the end of the study (July 2013). During the 2012 survey, farmers were asked an additional set of questions on basic household and individual level questions in order to broadly compare the quality, response rate and accuracy of responses to paper and phone surveys.,Half of the participants were randomly administered these questions in the paper survey, and the other half were asked the same questions on the phone. ,In the final paper survey, respondents also participated in a “willingness to pay” game. During the game, 75% of the respondents, selected at random, were asked if they would like to purchase AO at a series of different price points (in decreasing order, ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 0) Following this, they were given a pre-assigned scratch card where their randomized price is listed (ranging from Rs. 40 to Rs. 240). If the scratch card price was lower than their demand then the respondent could buy the product at the discounted price. The other 25%  played a “take it or leave it” game where they were simply asked if they are willing to purchase the service at X price where X is randomized between Rs. 40 and Rs. 240.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000678,Harvard University- Committee On the Use of Human Subjects in Research,2011-05-11,,"April 01, 2015",,,,,,,,,F20544
"Our intervention takes place in the context of the non-profit tax preparation industry, where low- and moderate-income tax filers receive free tax preparation assistance.19	These non-profits — referred to as Volunteer Income Tax Association (VITA) organizations — typically offer additional services to their customers, including enrollment assistance for public benefits and financial counseling. Our sampling frame, while not representative of the US population, is of direct interest to policymakers.

That is, we compare the relative responsiveness to an incentive received earlier in time (e.g. Febru- ary) to one received later in time (e.g. October) for individuals making a decision in advance (e.g. December) or on the spot (e.g. February). The intervention has six experimental arms. In particular, each participant belongs to either,the non-commitment or commitment group — the nomenclature is explained below. Within each of these groups, there are three arms. In the non-commitment group, there is a control arm, an early incentive treatment arm and a late incentive treatment arm.

"This project seeks to identify methods of increasing the use of mechanized desludging by increasing household willingness to pay for improved sanitation services. We investigate two broad mechanisms through which willingness to pay may change:  social network impacts and liquidity.  We test the impact of several social network interventions that encourage take-up through learning and social pressure, and the impact of payment and deposit interventions which affect the liquidity of the households.,The treatment group is comprised of four thousand households, grouped into 400 neighborhoods of 10 households each. A further 800 households (two per neighborhood) will be surveyed to evaluate the effects on those nearby who were not offered the subsidized mechanized desludgings.,Four thousand households will be randomly assigned to receive a subsidized price of either $34 or $48  for mechanized desludging services, which normally cost around $50. The subsidy is valid for a maximum of 2 desludgings over a nine month period. To measure learning from doing, researchers will see whether those who received subsidized services continue using mechanical desludging after the discount ends.,To understand the extent to which social pressure influences use of mechanized desludging, the attribution of the discounts will be made public for half of the clusters through the distribution of discount lists, and for the other half it will be offered privately. The impacts of learning from others and coordination will be measured when 1000 randomly chosen households in 200 clusters are first told either how many or specifically which of their neighbors have signed up, and are then given the opportunity to sign up. ,A number of payment structures will also be tested. Eighty-seven percent of households (3500) will be asked to leave a deposit at the time of the survey if they would like to sign up for the subsidized mechanized desludging. The remaining 500 treatment households will receive a subsidy for mechanical desludging, but will not be asked to leave a deposit.  One third of households will be asked to pay the remainder at the time of service, one third will be given a savings account earmarked for desludging and billed monthly, and one third will be given the same earmarked savings account, but allowed to contribute whenever they wish.

"The recruitment includes 3,420 subjects via Amazon Mechanical Turk (‘mTurk”). Upon agreeing to participate to the study (described simply as a “computerized questionnaire”) and to receive $.75 upon its completion (the tasks altogether took about 5 minutes, making the implied hourly slightly above the mTurk average for North America), the subjects are randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: ,•	Control: subjects in this experimental condition are first asked to express an opinion about their support for legalizing payments for organ donors and their families. Then, they are administered a survey with questions about their demographics and socio-economic characteristics. ,•	Organ text: individuals in this treatment condition are first informed that a text will be administered to them, and a comprehension question on its content will be asked afterwards. The text reports information about the extent of organ supply shortage in the United States, and described a number of proposals that have been advanced to reduce such shortage, with references to the academic studies advancing these proposals. They include the implemented kidney exchange programs as well as studies on the effect of introducing monetary compensations of donors. After having read the text, a comprehension question is given to the subjects. ,•	“Placebo” text: this condition has the same structure as the organ text treatment; however, instead of a text on organ supply shortage, a “morally neutral” text, concerning the causes of the flu and remedies for it, as well as a related comprehension question, is provided to the subjects.,We employ the “Item Count Technique” to elicit support rates for organ payment. The ITC is based on not asking a question directly (e.g., “Would you support the implementation for regulated payments for organ donors or their families?”); instead, respondents are shown a set of statements, and are then requested to state how many apply to them. The control group is given a list of N “neutral” statements (i.e., non-sensitive in nature and not related to our topic of interest), whereas the treatment group is given N+1 sentences, of which N are the same as for the control group, and the additional item is the one of interest for the researcher. Thus the researcher cannot infer if a given respondent answered positively or negatively to a given item; only the total number of items that apply to an individual is identified. This preserves the privacy of the respondents and, together with the anonymity of the online survey, allays the concern that they might give what they perceive to be the “socially correct” answer. In our case, the hypothetical framework might lead to a downward bias if most respondents believe that paying for organs is generally considered morally wrong. With subjects assigned randomly to various experimental conditions, the choice of statements that are not perfectly correlated (so that most individuals do not agree with all of them or none of them, thus effectively revealing their opinion on each signal statement), and a large enough sample size, the difference in the average counts between treatment and control gives an estimate of the share of individuals in the population under study to which the phrase of interest applies. The key question in our survey asks the respondents to indicate how many of the listed statements apply to them. In the control condition, four statements were reported, and in the treatment conditions, the fifth statement is a sentence indicating that the respondent would support the establishment of a regulated system of payment for organs. Thus within each of the treatment conditions described above, subjects are further randomly divided in two subgroups, one receiving four statement, and one receiving five statements.,A similar design (but without a placebo group) is also implemented for two further activities: legalizing indoor prostitution, and legalizing slavery.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000540,"Johns Hopkins University Homewood Institutional Review Board,University of Toronto Office of Research Ethics","2014-05-01,2014-05-12",,"November 09, 2014",,,,,,,,,"HIRB00001991,30238"
"The role of the entrepreneur in business and development success has grown in interest among policy makers and researchers in both developed and developing economies. While often left out of formal theories, the entrepreneur plays a key role in the exchange of goods and development of innovation. The role of the entrepreneur in development is of especially important concern in regions where formal sector employment is scarce. ,Uganda, like most low-income countries in the world, has a large share of youth who are either unemployed or underemployed.  This is not only a concern of the welfare of these youth, but also a waste of valuable human capital available for economic growth.  Youth living in these countries encounter numerous challenges entering into and succeeding in the labor market. Living in economies where employment opportunities are scarce and self-employment often the only option, youth need the right combination of human, financial, and social capital that will give them a chance to turn their energy and ideas into entrepreneurship opportunities that lead to the creation of more and better jobs.  ,Individuals often lack knowledge of the best practices of running of business, especially in developing countries, where education in general is often limited. An intervention growing in popularity is the introduction of business skills training. The goal is to increase the knowledge individual business owners have about doing business, and while doing so, also increase their returns and welfare. ,A number of recent research projects have explored the impact of enterprise training and have found mixed results. Oosterbeek, van Praag and Ijsselstein (2010) find that business skills training has no effect on business outcomes. Bjorvatn and Tungodden (2010) find that business training in Tanzania has some effect on business knowledge, but no effect on business outcomes. Karlan and Valdivia (2006) include business training in a microfinance institute in Peru. The program lead to increased business knowledge, revenue and repayment rates, but had no effect on profits. Attanasio et al (2011) subsidized vocational training in Colombia and found income and employment increases for women, but none for men. Blattman, Fiala and Martinez (2011) find high returns to a grant program in Uganda for business training and capital for men and women, with large long-term effects for women. They find though that alleviating capital constraints were the major reason behind business success, with a small role for business training. ,At best the current literature presents conflicting results of the usefulness of entrepreneurship training. At worst it suggests such programs are not sustainable. The questions being asked in the literature though are unsatisfactory when it comes to answering definitively the value of entrepreneurship training, in part because they are asking too broad of a question. Each of the evaluations described focus on a package of entrepreneurship training initiated by one or more NGOs or training facilities. It is not clear what exactly is in this package, whether it is comparable across programs or countries, or even whether it can be replicated in the same area. Rather than asking what makes a good entrepreneur, they are throwing a black box program at individuals and seeing if that particular program works in that particular place. It is not surprising then that the results are somewhat contradictory. Entrepreneurship training thus works for women only in some programs, or men only in others. Some increase revenues, other have no effect.  ,In order to determine if entrepreneurship can be taught, and if that teaching can then lead to real improved real world outcomes, a clear theory of the entrepreneur needs to be developed. The theory should then be tested through precise experiments that parse out the individual components of entrepreneurship to determine what, if anything, can be taught. This will lead to a clearer understanding of what enterprise training works, how it works, and if it can be replicated. ,This pre-analysis plan is for an experiment to determine a major component of what type of training improves business development. We focus on the differential effect of what is commonly referred to as “hard” skills (e.g., financial decision making) and “soft” skills (e.g., negotiation and communication). This project will investigate the relative importance of hard skills versus soft skills in business success and more broadly in the youth’s school-to-work transition.  The project will strengthen, experimentally, the training of these skills among recently graduated Ugandan secondary school students. The goal of the current endeavor is to: (a) leverage insights from the economic and social sciences toward the goal of improving entrepreneurial success in developing countries, and (b) test whether “hard” versus “soft” skills better predict consequential entrepreneurial and business longevity outcomes, and a better performance in the labor market, particularly among young people and women.,The hard skills training was built upon a currently existing hard skills-based curricula developed by the ILO called Know About Business (KAB), which has been run in over 40 countries worldwide. The newly developed curriculum will focus on financial literacy, the role of budgeting, calculating and keeping track of expenses, revenue and profits, the importance of re-investment for business growth, and a number of other topics. ,The soft skills training was built upon existing soft skills-based curricula harvested from both the Young Entrepreneurs Program (YEP) and Educate!, a local NGO that mentors young people in starting businesses. These existing curricula will be refined through guidance from economic and social science research pointing to the critical importance of a few core social skills areas including: building and accessing social networks, how to influence and persuade, how to perceive and listen to others, and how to effectively and creatively negotiate. The full development of this component will build on the existing undergraduate business curriculum at major business school and will be adapted and rigorously piloted tested to match the Ugandan context.,As the target population of the evaluation is youth who have recently finished school, the research will first measure the effect of entrepreneurship training on attitudes and skills. The project will also measure the training on positive labor market outcomes and business success (such as self-employment, business creation, job creation through start-ups, and earnings). The project will then ultimately assess the importance of soft skills versus hard skills. The research will provide evidence on how these skills help to build better, sustainable and bankable businesses.

This lottery provides an opportunity to gauge the effects of expanding access to public health insurance on the health care use, financial strain, and health of low-income adults using a randomized controlled design. In the year after random assignment, the treatment group selected by the lottery was about 25 percentage points more likely to have insurance than the control group that was not selected. We find that in this first year, the treatment group had substantively and statistically significantly higher health care utilization (including primary and preventive care as well as hospitalizations), lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical debt (including fewer bills sent to collection), and better self-reported physical and mental health than the control group.,Despite imminent expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, the effects of expanding coverage are unclear. Oregon’s 2008 Medicaid expansion using lottery drawings from a waiting list provides an opportunity to evaluate the effects of Medicaid using random assignment. Approximately two years after the lottery, we collected data from 6,387 adults randomly selected to be able to apply for Medicaid coverage and 5,842 not selected. Measures included blood pressure, cholesterol and glycosylated hemoglobin; a depression screen; medication catalogs; and self-reported diagnoses, health, health care utilization and out-of-pocket spending. We use the lottery’s random assignment to calculate the effect of Medicaid coverage.We found no statistically significant effect of Medicaid on the prevalence, diagnosis, or medication of hypertension or high cholesterol. Medicaid coverage significantly increased the diagnosis of diabetes and use of diabetes medication, but we observed no significant effect on average glycosylated hemoglobin levels nor on the percent with levels >6.5%. Medicaid coverage decreased the probability of screening positive for depression (-9.15 percentage points; 95% CI: -16.70 to -1.60; P=0.018), increased use of preventive services, and almost eliminated catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures. Thus, evidence using a randomized controlled design showed that Medicaid coverage generated no statistically significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first two years, but did generate increased health care use, higher rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and lower financial strain.,In 2008, a group of uninsured low-income adults in Oregon was selected by lottery for the chance to apply for Medicaid. We use this randomized design and 2009 administrative data to evaluate the effect of Medicaid on labor market outcomes and participation in other social safety net programs. We find no significant effect of Medicaid on employment or earnings: our 95 percent confidence intervals allow us to reject that Medicaid causes a decline in employment of more than 4.4 percentage points, or an increase of more than 1.2 percentage points. We find that Medicaid increases receipt of food stamps, but has little, if any, impact on receipt of other government benefits, including SSDI.,In 2008, Oregon initiated a limited expansion of a Medicaid program for uninsured, low-income adults, drawing names from a waiting list by lottery. This lottery created a rare opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage using a randomized controlled design. Using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency department records from Portland-area hospitals, we study the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over approximately 18 months after the lottery. We find that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40 percent relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group. We find increases in emergency department visits across a broad range of types of visits, conditions, and subgroups, including increases in visits for conditions that may be most readily treatable in primary care settings.","0804002701,OHRA P17925,08-64A,09-26A,FWA 3692,HSRRC 08501"
"The objective of this intervention is to reduce attrition amongst midwives by providing them with retention incentives.,All midwives who are part of this intervention are employed by SURE-P in SURE-P Primary Health Centres (PHC). In order to promote retention, midwives that remain at their duty health facility for increments of three months are eligible to receive a package of retention incentives every three months. The incentives are cumulative, i.e. a midwife cannot qualify for the second three months’ incentive if she has not qualified for the first three months’, and so on. ,The implementation of SURE-P is divided in two phases. Phase 1 includes the first 500 PHCs to begin implementing the program, while Phase 2 expands this to a further 500 PHCs.

"The intervention consists of three components: scripted lesson plans, additional reading resources and in-class instructional coaching and training.,The scripted lesson plans provide specification of the new instructional practice including faster paced instruction, more appropriately sequenced content, and dramatically expanded pedagogic repertoires.  Specifically in primary school teaching reading in the First Additional Language, the new expanded repertoires include systematic teaching of phonemic awareness and phonics; strategies that focus on increased reading speeds or fluency; guided reading strategies; vocabulary development and strategies that improve comprehension.,The role of the learning materials is to provide the appropriate resources to ensure that learners are able to develop and consolidate knowledge and skills related to reading fluency, vocabulary development and guided reading. Twelve sets of graded reading books are provided.,The role of in-class support is to fuse capacity-building and accountability.  The in-class support allows for modelling of the new practice on site and the gradual development of teachers in the new practice from novice to expert.  The in-class support also allows teachers to manage the emotional labour, i.e. stress, insecurity and anxiety associated with developing a new professional practice mid-career.

"The study will provide grant money ($12,500 total) and guidance to schools/departments to implement various intervention programs aimed at recruiting more undergraduate women into the economics major. Each school/department will design their own intervention program, although some elements may be similar between schools/departments. Interventions can be classified into one or more of the following three categories depending on the area that they target: ,- Better Information: Without accurate information about the broader application of economics (e.g., beyond finance and consulting), women are more likely to major in less rigorous fields, often within the social sciences or humanities, that seem to provide more application to the theory behind economics. ,- Mentoring and Role Models: Women are more sensitive to their grades in introductory courses when choosing their major than are men. The creation of networks among students within the department and showing support for their decision to major in the field has been effective in recruiting underrepresented minorities. ,- Content and Presentation Style: On average, female undergraduates are less confident about their quantitative skills than are men even if they are equally able and prepared. Their lack of confidence may diminish their belief that economics fits their personal strengths and abilities. ,These three areas were identified based on discussion with a board of experts, consisting of economics educators and experts in economics pedagogy, at the November 2014 Planning Group Meeting, as well as focus groups conducted with students at some of the treatment institutions. Actual interventions can include, but are not limited to:,- inviting alumni/guest speakers who work in diverse fields other than finance and consulting for a lecture series or a panel discussion about the application of economics in their work;,- increasing the number of female TAs/graduate students/older undergraduate mentors;,- helping students find summer jobs that value economics, are dynamic, and include human contact;,- having informal lunches with professors and TAs;,- supporting independent/group projects in various sub-fields such as health, poverty, crime, inequality, sports, and others, or supplementing introductory and intermediate theory economics courses with modules in these sub-fields;,- making sections more conductive to learning for students with different skill levels, styles of learning, and interests, ,and many more.

"Motivation and Program Description,Livestock agriculture accounts for twelve percent of GDP in Pakistan, and is a key growth sector for the rural poor, as in much of South Asia (Pakistan Economic Survey 2013-14). The market for livestock faces many of the same imperfections in developing countries as do land or crop markets, however. We are currently implementing in partnership with the Punjab Livestock and Dairy Department a data-driven, state capacity building technological solution to one key public service adoption problem---failure to use artificial insemination (AI) services.,Problem,The market for AI suffers from two informational inefficiencies. First, since insemination can fail even when executed perfectly, livestock owners cannot know whether failure is due to poor effort by technicians or to unavoidable biological causes. Second, while reporting successful insemination and subsequent dairy productivity is low-cost and provides considerable public benefits, citizens have no private incentives to provide this information. These inefficiencies lead to rates of pregnancy and dairy production that are much lower than expected given the technology being used.,Technological solution,We are in the process of running a randomized control trial to evaluate a technology that activates the cellular network to overcome these two informational inefficiencies. We have developed a cellular based information clearinghouse---along the lines of yelp.com and angieslist.com. This clearinghouse uses Android smartphones equipped with an Open Data Kit-based application to collect real-time information on all public AI service provision in one district of Punjab, Sahiwal. This data automatically populates an online dashboard and generates phone calls to farmers to verify service provision and to determine if artificially inseminated animals became pregnant. This data on AI success, an objective measure of veterinary officer (vet) quality, as well as data on cost per AI provision, is then aggregated at the vet level and reported to farmers directly via phone calls and SMS messages. Farmers are not only given the quality level of their past vet but also of other vets in their geographical area.,We have implemented the final stage of this technological solution, information provision to farmers about the quality of nearby vets, as a randomized control trial. We seek to measure the impact of this information provision on farmers, vets, and the market for AI in Sahiwal.,Information provision,Treated farmers are given information on the top three vets within 3km of their household in terms of weighted success in artificially inseminating cows, and the top three vets in terms of weighted success in artificially inseminating buffalo. ,All treated farmers are given success rates and average prices charged for these three to six vets (their can be overlap in the most successful vets in terms of cows and buffalo) on the phone and via SMS. Farmers are also offered vets' phone numbers, information on farmer reported satisfaction with vets, and any information on any other vet in our system.

"The SUSTAIN project interventions consist of implementing the following components/sub-components under an integrated agriculture-nutrition-marketing approach of scaling up the dissemination of orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP). This is referred as the 'Base model' in the RCT design.,1.	Agriculture: The agriculture component includes two sub-components—vine distribution and agronomic training. The project plans to distribute vines of improved OFSP varieties to households with children less than 5 years old or with pregnant women. About 100 vines each of two selected improved varieties will be distributed free of cost to eligible households, followed by a second round of vine dissemination in the third season to the same households, but at a subsidized cost which will be a fraction of the normal cost. These beneficiary households will be targeted through farmer organizations or farmer field schools (FFS). Under the agronomic training sub-component, all the members (men or women) of the farmer organization or the farmer field school that will be targeted by the project for vine distribution will receive agronomic training on growing OFSP at the time of vine distribution and during the growing season.,2.	Nutrition: This component encompasses two strategic elements or sub-components—messaging and counseling. All the members of the farmer organization or the farmer field school (men and women), and pregnant women and lactating mothers who visit the local health facilities will receive nutritional ‘messages’ on the importance of OFSP as a source of vitamin A, which is essential for good health, and how OFSP as part of a balanced diet contributes to vitamin A intake. The nutrition ‘counseling’ sub-component will include incorporating the promotion of OFSP consumption in the on-going nutrition education curriculum of the community health worker and health center. In this counseling component, the emphasis will be on 'doing', 'demonstrating' and 'showing' rather than simply telling/informing about OFSP. All the women and caregivers in the village with children less than 5 years and pregnant women will be targeted for the counseling sub-component of the nutrition intervention. The SUSTAIN project will link the nutrition component with the planned and ongoing health and nutrition activities implemented by the Rwanda Ministry of Health through the health centers and community health workers (CHWs).,3.	Marketing:  The marketing interventions will include two sub-components—training and market linkage. All the members of the farmer groups and FFS that received vines will also receive in-depth (but context specific) training (delivered several times during the project phase) on how to process OFSP, market it, meet the demand for roots quality, and organize finances. Under the market linkage sub-component, the SUSTAIN project will actively promote the linkage between OSFP growers and processors and other actors in the value chain. This sub-component will focus on a proactive action by the project to find processors willing to work with farmers and then equipping the farmers with knowledge, tools and skills to ensure they meet the processors’ requirements in terms of roots quality and delivery schedules.

"The Green Bank of Caraga, along with researchers, designed and implemented a commitment savings product called a SEED (Save, Earn, Enjoy Deposits) account. The SEED account provided individuals with a commitment to restrict access to their savings, thus potentially helping with either self-control or family-control issues. Each individual defined either a goal date or amount, and was subsequently unable to withdraw from the account until the goal was reached. Other than providing a possible commitment savings device, no further benefit accrued to individuals with this account: the interest rate paid on the SEED account was identical to the interest paid on a normal savings account (4 percent per annum).,Researchers trained a team of marketers hired by the partnering bank to visit the homes or businesses of existing bank clients in the commitment-treatment group, to stress the importance of savings to them. This process included eliciting the clients’ motivations for savings, and emphasizing to the client that even small amounts of saving make a difference; marketers then offered them the SEED product. Another group of individuals (the marketing-treatment group) received the exact same marketing script, but were not expressly offered the SEED product.

A number of government, non-profit, and for profit institutions have created free or highly subsidized programs to provide basic financial literacy training to low income households.

In this study, we conduct a randomized control trial with real microfinance borrowers in Northern India to determine whether a financial literacy program improves financial literacy levels and increases the achievement of savings goals. The savings program we evaluate builds on prior interventions by providing (1) substantially more interactive time with the instructor (nine 1 hour sessions), (2) follow up visits to monitor progress, and (3) by harnessing the group structure of microfinance to allow for the possibility that learning with others increases retention.

"Saving for Change (SfC), is a community-based savings group program developed by Oxfam America/Freedom From Hunger.  The SfC program builds on the accumulating savings and credit association (ASCA) model, enabling women to organize themselves into simple savings and credit groups. The group members, with technical support from the NGO, are fully responsible for managing funds in the group, making decisions on who receives a loan and the loan amount, and setting the terms and conditions of the loans- including rules on weekly contributions, interest rates and penalties for delayed contributions or repayments. Each group consists of approximately 20 women. ,At meetings, each woman contributes a savings amount (previously established by the members) to a communal pool, which grows in aggregate size each time the group meets. When a woman needs a loan, she proposes the desired amount to the group. Once all demand has been voiced, the group collectively discusses whether there are enough funds and how to divide funds, and prioritizes requests if there is more demand than funds. Loans must be repaid with interest, at a rate set ex ante by the members. Each group manages its own funds which are entirely internally generated (with no matching or external loans provided), and all transactions occur in front of the group for full transparency. At a predetermined date, the cycle ends and the group divides the entire fund among members, which is referred to as a share-out. In order to address the problem of low literacy rates in Mali, SfC uses an oral accounting system to keep track of savings amounts and outstanding loans.,The SfC-promoting NGOs offer significant technical support to SfC groups. The SfC groups are formed and supported by two types of agents: “hired agents” (paid employees of a local NGO and trained formally), and “replicating agents” (local women from a village in which a hired agent formed a group, and trained more informally by the hired agents). The program aims to generate many replicating agents, thus giving the program independence from the activities of the NGO. ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000102,"Innovations for Poverty Action IRB -  USA,Yale University Human Subjects Committee","2008-11-25,2009-01-30",,"November 13, 2013",,,,Yes,,"June 01, 2012, 12:00 AM +00:00",,,"08November-001,0901004689"

"Developed in 2003, EBLI comprises several instructional strategies to improve reading accuracy, fluency and comprehension. EBLI targets teachers and reading specialists at any grade level (K-12) and instructs them on how to implement its literacy strategies in whole class, small group or one-on-one sessions. Since first developing the system, EBLI has trained thousands of teachers across the country and has reached tens of thousands of students. Over 260 schools, mainly located in Michigan, have implemented the EBLI system. ,At its core, EBLI is a phonics-based reading program. The program’s theory of change states that mastered reading accuracy has subsequent beneficial effects on students’ reading fluency and comprehension. The emphasis on improving reading accuracy differentiates EBLI from other whole language/balanced literacy systems that focus first on fluency and speed by encouraging word guessing when students are unsure about the correct pronunciation.,To achieve reading accuracy, EBLI uses awareness of sounds (phonetic awareness) and the different ways the same sound can be spelled. The program emphasizes several key concepts. The first concept (“1, 2, 3 or 4 Letters Can Represent a Sound”) highlights the fact that individual sounds in the English language may be comprised of anywhere from one to four letters. For instance, the sound “u” in up is made of one letter – u. The sound “e” in tea is made of two letters – ea. The sound “ur” sound in earn is made of three letters – ear. And, finally, the “ay” sound in weigh is made of four letters – eigh. The second concept (“Same Sound / Different Spelling”) captures the idea that same sound can be spelled with many different combinations of letters. For example, the “ee” sound in feet is spelled with ee; the “ee” sound in treat is spelled with ea; the “ee” sound in brief is spelled with ie. The third concept (“Same Spelling / Different Sound”) is the converse – namely, in the English language the same spelling may create different sounds in words. For instance, the spelling “ea” sounds like the following sounds in different words: sounds like “ee” in beast, “a” in break, and “e” in head. ,EBLI teachers also learn how to teach students phonemic awareness skills such as segmenting, blending and phoneme manipulation within the context of single and multi-syllable words as opposed to in isolation. In segmenting, teachers break words into individual syllables and further into sounds within syllables. For example, “brother” is separated into two syllables – bro / ther and each of these syllables is broken into sounds – b r o / th er. This separation helps to reinforce correct spelling. In blending, instruction focuses on pushing individual sounds together to create a word. For the segmented “brother”, the sounds are blended back together to form the full word and reinforce correct pronunciation. Phoneme manipulation activities help reinforce word comprehension and spelling by removing letters from the words and reviewing what remains. For instance, focusing on the word “spot”, the instructor will first ask how many sounds are in the word spot, then will ask what “spot” is without the /s/, what “spot” is without the /p/. The student may segment the individual sounds or may say “pot” or “sot”. Then the instructor repeats the exercise, using dots in the place of letters. Using dots in place of letters forces the student to listen to individual sounds.,According to its developers, EBLI differs in several important ways from other popular phonics-based reading programs such as Orton-Gillingham, Open Court, Saxon Phonics, Wilson, and Lexia (software). First, EBLI is a system of logic rather than a set of phonics rules, exceptions and drills. Second, EBLI developers argue that typical phonics programs focus more heavily on drill and worksheets with less focus on reading in books. Third, EBLI trains teachers to be diagnostic and prescriptive when delivering instruction as opposed to training them to simply deliver pre-fabricated materials to students. For example, the EBLI system of instruction includes guidance for teachers on how to provide error corrections in the moment. Finally, EBLI instruction is multi-sensory, with students saying, seeing, hearing and writing in the course of EBLI activities. ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000900,University of Michigan,2014-05-21,,"October 14, 2015",,,,,,,,,HUM00087611 
"The Making Ghana Girls Great (MGCubed) program, implemented by the Global Education Management System (GEMS), is based on the premise that diminished learning time, due to high rates of teacher and student absenteeism, contributes to low learning levels, and that a lack of female role models contributes to a high drop out rate for girls. ,The program introduces distance learning and after-school girls club called the Wonder Women, both led by facilitators from the community, most of them female.

"Together with our partner Femina HIP, a leading NGO on reproductive health in Tanzania, we have decided to focus on girls who are in their last year of secondary school (Form IV in Tanzania). They are in the age interval where we observe a sharp increase in fertility.

We used a clustered randomized controlled trial to estimate the effectiveness of a U.S. government-funded farmer training program that trained more than 50,000 farmers throughout Armenia. Three years after farmers received training, training did not increase household income or consumption. Training also did not affect mediating outcomes, such as adoption of agricultural practices or changes in cultivation of crops, which suggests that longer-term impacts are unlikely to materialize. Many farmers lacked the financial means to invest in the types of practices that were the focus of the curricula, and farmers were also often unwilling to try new crops that have higher up-front costs even if they are much more profitable in the long run. Our findings highlight the challenges that even a well-implemented training program has in spurring behavioral change among farmers and the challenges of providing effective services when foreign aid agencies prioritize having a large programmatic footprint. These challenges were central to the lack of impacts of this particular program but are underplayed when foreign aid agencies decide whether to fund agricultural training programs.",

"We study the following four treatments, all randomly assigned at the individual level: (1) video-based financial literacy education, (2) paying participants for performance on an exit test (“pay for performance”), (3) financial counseling, and (4) financial goal setting. We discuss each of these interventions in more detail below.,* Financial Education,Participants in this treatment were invited to attend a video-based financial literacy training program. The financial education videos include the following five topics: budgeting, savings, loans, insurance, and a final summary video. To avoid bias from Hawthorne-type effects, the control group was assigned to watch health education videos. These health training videos cover information unrelated to financial literacy, specifically: cleanliness and hygiene; midwife, maternal and child health; condoms, AIDS and syphilis; and night-blindness. ,* Pay for Performance,In this treatment, monetary incentives were provided to participants based on their performance on a follow up survey. The survey was administered to the respondent’s household 2 to 3 weeks after the final video training session. It consisted of both financial and health literacy test questions, all drawn directly from the video training. Respondents receive Rs. 10 for each question that they answer correctly, but we vary which questions individuals are compensated for. Specifically, half the participants, selected individually at random, and independent of their financial education treatment status, are paid for correct answers to questions related to the videos they watched (i.e. health training participants receive compensation for health test questions, and similarly for financial literacy training participants). The other half are paid for correct answers to questions that are not covered in their video training (i.e. financial literacy training participants get paid for health or general knowledge test questions, and vice versa)., * Goal Setting,Individuals in this treatment received a household visit and are first asked about whether they currently use, or plan to use, financial services and financial planning tools. Next, they are asked to set a target date for several financial planning goals (i.e. opening a savings account, increasing savings, reducing expenditure, purchasing insurance). These target dates are then marked on a calendar provided to respondents at no cost.,* Counseling,Those in this group received an offer of financial counseling, independent of their goal setting treatment status. Specifically, financial counselors visited the counseling treatment group in their home to provide individualized financial counseling services. The financial counselors assisted participants on several issues—including but not limited to preparing a budget, opening a bank account, paying off or re-financing loans, purchasing an insurance policy—depending on their needs.

"Teach For America (TFA) is a program that strives to reduce educational inequities through the provision of high–quality teachers to low–income schools. The program recruits and trains college graduates with strong academic backgrounds and leadership capabilities to commit to teach for two years in public schools in low–income communities. These teachers, called corps members, typically have no formal training in education but receive an intensive five–week training from TFA before beginning their first teaching job. They also receive ongoing support from TFA throughout their two–year commitment. ,In 2010, TFA launched a major expansion effort, funded in part by a five–year Investing in Innovation (i3) Scale–Up grant of $50 million from the U.S. Department of Education’s (ED’s) Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII). This was one of four i3 scale–up grants, which were awarded to fund expansion of programs with rigorous evidence of prior effectiveness in improving student achievement. Through the i3 scale–up project, TFA plans to increase the size of its teacher corps by more than 80 percent by September 2014, with the goal of placing 13,500 first– and second–year corps members in classrooms by the 2014–2015 school year, expanding from 39 to 52 to 54 regions across the country, and accounting for more than 20 percent of new hires in high–poverty schools in these regions.,TFA has contracted with Mathematica Policy Research to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the i3 scale–up project’s effectiveness. This evaluation will include an analysis of the scale–up’s implementation as well as an analysis of the impact of elementary school TFA teachers recruited in the first and second years of the scale–up. ",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000184,New England IRB,2012-07-13,,"December 28, 2013",,,,,,,,,12-192

"The Disseminating Innovative Resources and Technologies to Smallholders (DIRTS) project will use a randomized controlled trial to measure the impact of improved flows of extension information, access to agricultural input packages, and rainfall index insurance on agricultural intensification, specifically the use of fertilizers and improved seeds.,To further examine the importance of weather-related risk to farm investment, all farmers in our study will be able to purchase a commercial rainfall index insurance product, developed by the Ghana Insurers Association (GIA). In 2014 we will offer free insurance to a randomly-selected subset of our sample, and actuarially-fair insurance to everyone else.  ,Based on past experience, we expect take-up to be at or near 100% for the free insurance, and low for actuarially-fair insurance. We anticipate a strong investment response to the free insurance. In year 2, given that communities now have experience with the insurance, we expect that there will be strong demand at actuarially fair and higher prices. We will also experiment with marketing by local notables, to see if this increases demand.,Second, to test the importance of unsure, untimely and costly access to agricultural inputs, DIRTS will make commercial fertilizer, improved seeds and other agricultural inputs available to selected communities at different points during the year instead of just after land preparation. These inputs will be sold at market price by existing agro-input dealers, who are based in the districts. The project will facilitate linkages between these suppliers and the communities by organizing marketing events and subsidizing transport. The primary linkage will be provided by community marketing agents (CMA) based in each community.,Third, to test the importance of imperfect farmer knowledge of farming best practices, randomly selected communities will be provided with more intensive extension through a Community Extension Agent (CEA).

"Dairy represents an important income source in the lives of the rural poor. As a result, organizational innovations that raise productivity or quality in the dairy sector could have deep implications for a broad range of people. ,Rural smallholders are generally organized into village cooperatives where they take their milk each day. At the co-op level, the milk of all member producers is combined to aggregate fixed storage/ shipping costs and sold to a regional dairy, which then chills, tests, and packages the milk for distribution. The purchase price at the dairy is based on quality, which is a composite measure of fat content and solid non-fats (SNFs), without including enough penalties for increased microbial load that significantly affects the quality.,The cooperative structure generates both collective action and coordination problems within villages. Losses due to these failures are particularly noticeable in terms of sanitary conditions associated with milk collection practices at the local village level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS). This has been revealed through our pilot studies and consultations with the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), a quasi-governmental dairy that is the largest federation of local DCSs in the Indian state of Karnataka. Most DCSs pay a flat procurement price to each farmer based on volume produced, with not much variation based on individual quality. The only potential incentive is that a cooperative may lose its entire payment for a day if milk is found to be spoilt on arrival at the district level union. Such punishments are very indirectly passed on to farmers, and most are unaware when the cooperative doesn’t receive payment. This procurement strategy may generate incentives for individuals to free-ride, avoiding time-intensive clean milking practices. Additionally, the structure also fails to monitor the accountability at the DCS level for proper washing and disinfection of milk pails, trays and other equipment used for milk procurement.,We will work with the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) to raise average dairy hygiene through reforms in the incentive scheme for local level institutions (DCS). Within the state of Karnataka, we plan to implement under the jurisdiction of Dharwad Milk Union, a second-tier organization in the federation as per recommendation from KMF.,We plan to implement a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess mechanisms to address collective action failure through incentive channels that may affect dairy hygiene. The KMF may redesign their payment schedule and village-level services in accordance with our findings.,Our experimental design intends to measure the effect of incentive structure and the consequent changes in members’ bargaining power on microbiological quality of milk. We propose three treatments to evaluate how a given incentive structure influences the DCS behaviour towards dairy hygiene. We will also disseminate information on clean milk production in all groups (including the control group) through posters, to eliminate any confounding effects caused by awareness gaps.,(0) Control: In the control group, we will test  pooled milk samples from a DCS. No monetary incentives will be paid.,Treatment Groups:  ,(1)	T1. We will pay an incentive based on a pre-determined scale to the DCS’ bank account for each round of testing. We will make it explicit that we will not be sharing this information with any producers (members).,(2)	T2. We will pay an incentive based on a pre-determined scale to the DCS’ bank account for each round of testing. Prior to the date of testing, we will communicate to the DCS that producers will be informed of the DCS’ performance and realized monetary rewards ex-post. This claim will be credibly carried out through a poster and distribution of flyers.  ,(3)	T3.  We will pay an incentive based on a pre-determined scale to the DCS’ bank account for each round of testing. Prior to the date of testing, we communicate to the DCS that producers will be informed of rewards associated with DCS’ results ex-ante, and of the DCS’ performance and realized monetary rewards ex-post. Both claims will be credibly carried out. The endline survey will measure the extent to which well—informed producers can discipline local level institutions.,In all treatments, we will measure the microbial load in milk through a test called Methylene Blue Reduction Test (MBRT).  For all tests, samples of milk will be collected by surveyors employed by JPAL South Asia and testing will be done by a third party vendor. Confidentiality norms mandated by the IRB will be met as samples will not carry any personally identifiable information but rather be referred through unique identifiers (UID). The intervention comprises 2-3 rounds of testing.,Baseline surveys:,We propose to introduce the following survey instruments to gather baseline data on Dairy Cooperative Societies’ (DCSs) institutional structure and to target specific experiments: ,(a)	Baseline survey for Directors: This survey will be answered by directors of DCSs. Each DCS has a managing committee comprising 11 directors. In our experimental design, we propose two treatments to incentivize these directors’ participation in clean milk procurement. This survey includes questions on socio-economic characteristics, their centrality within their social network, peer evaluation, and awareness of clean milking practices.,(b)	Baseline survey of Testers/Helpers: This survey will be answered by testers (or helpers) of DCSs who are responsible for measuring milk quality and for equipment upkeep. This survey will measure baseline level of testers’ performance and degree of accountability to other institutional actors. ,(c)	Baseline survey of Secretaries: This survey will be answered by secretaries of DCSs, who are responsible for day-to-day operations of the society. This survey will measure baseline level of secretaries’ performance and degree of accountability to other institutional actors.,(d)	Baseline survey of Producers: This survey will be answered by a subset of dairy producers who are the pouring members of the DCS. This survey will measure producers’ evaluation of their directors, tester, and secretary on a number of performance and personality measures. At end-line, we propose to examine if our interventions have affected any changes in these perceptions.  ,An endline survey is currently being designed.

"From our exploratory research it is clear that it is best to include a learner’s license component in the design. Thus the intervention would include subsidized training for a learner’s as well as a driver’s license. Partnering with TMI Dynamatics will facilitate implementation and avoid high attrition rates as they have more than 2 years of experience in this field. The actual training for the learner’s and driver’s license will follow the TMI tested process. The training for the learner’s license is classroom-style computer based learning. This includes regular assessments and progress updates to ensure that candidates are progressing satisfactorily. The pace of this training will be determined by the capabilities of the candidates.,The driver’s license training makes use of various tools. These include on the road lessons in car, lessons in a simulator where skills learned in the car are reinforced, and K53 theory lessons. Lessons are video-taped for analysis, and candidates are regularly assessed and their progress closely monitored. Again, the pace of the driver’s license training is determined by the capabilities of the candidates.,Assistance is also provided for the booking of Driver’s License Testing Centre (DLTC) tests, as well as transport to and from the tests.,The extent of the subsidy could go so far as to fully subsidise the entire cost of obtaining a driver’s license, including the cost of booking and issuance fees payable to the DLTCs. In this scenario there would however need to be some form of financial commitment from the candidate in order to ensure that they complete the training. For example there might be a deposit required which will only be refunded once the candidate has completed their training and/or attended 90% of their lessons. Alternatively the candidates could be required to finance 15 – 20% of the total cost of the training, the purpose being the same as the refundable deposit.

The public-labeling treatment was similar except that the group discussion encouraged members to make commitments to themselves as well as to others in their group in order to explore the possibility that this might lead to different outcomes. As in the private-labeling treatment members were asked to voluntarily state a savings purpose and weekly savings goals in writing, but in this intervention, those commitments were shared with all members of the group. By doing this, individuals explicitly label their ‘mental savings account’ and publicly commit to their own decision.

"The AHME package is a set of interventions that seek to improve private health care delivery inefficiencies by integrating supply- and demand-side interventions. The primary focus of the supply-side interventions will be to improve and expand the delivery of high quality health care services through a private network of providers. In the first stage of the supply-side intervention, AHME implementation partners Marie Stopes International (MSI) and Population Services International (PSI) will expand the scope and scale of their existing franchise model. MSI and PSI will expand the scope of existing family planning services to include: maternal and perinatal care, and malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia treatment services for children less than 5 years old (with plans to add child nutrition and TB services in later years). In addition, MSI and PSI will expand the scale of their services to include new private clinics in both Eastern and Western Kenya. MSI and PSI will recruit new providers (private clinics) to their respective franchise models and provide training and support in franchised services (e.g., clinical protocols and clinical best practices), subsidize select clinical materials, and provide marketing (branding and community demand generation messaging). As part of their recruitment into the MSI and PSI franchises, private clinics agree to maintain records that MSI/PSI can monitor for quality assurance (annual visits), abide by price limits for services and materials, and pay membership fees. The franchise intervention will be rolled out in the first year of the intervention among randomly selected clinics; the order in which treatment clinics are recruited by MSI and PSI will also be randomized. ,In conjunction with franchising efforts, PharmAccess will roll out its ""SafeCare""/Medical Credit Fund (MCF) intervention to MSI/PSI franchisees. The goal of the SafeCare/MCF intervention is to first improve quality assurance systems within clinics by providing clinics with a quality improvement plan based on observed operations. The SafeCare process includes a monitoring system with step-based certificates to reward clinic quality improvements. As clinics achieve ""higher"" steps (improve quality) they will become eligible for MCF loans. It is expected that increased access to capital will allow providers (private clinics) to make the necessary investment to further improve the quality and range of services they offer.,Demand-side financing (DSF) and information and communication technology (ICT) components of the AHME package will be randomly overlayed franchising and supply-side financing interventions in later years of the evaluation.

This service helps students to navigate the community college system and absorb shocks in their personal life that threaten their ability to complete a degree. Emergency Financial Assistance provides students with resources to cover emergency non-academic expenses or income shortfalls that could negatively impact their persistence in college.

"There are six main stages in the Growth Vouchers programme: ,Stage 1 is the initial application stage in which businesses apply to join the programme. The application process must be completed online at GOV.UK.,The Growth Vouchers programme is open to any business based in England that has been running for at least one year, has fewer than 50 employees, and has not paid for external strategic advice in the past three years. ,As part of the application process, eligible businesses will complete a brief questionnaire that is designed to help assess what type of business advice might benefit them most. ,At Stage 2, businesses carry out an assessment of their business advice needs. They can do this by completing an online assessment or meeting with an adviser. Meetings with an adviser may be carried out over the telephone but most businesses will book an appointment and arrange to meet in person. ,At Stage 3, businesses will receive a recommendation for advice in one of five areas (see below) and then select their preferred area of advice. Businesses will then be told whether they have been allocated a Growth Voucher to help pay for the cost of advice. ,A majority of businesses that reach this stage will receive a voucher. This allocation will be random: no assessment about the viability of the business will be made. This is to ensure that a wide range of businesses receive a voucher and that the impact of advice can be measured effectively.,Growth Vouchers may be used to subsidise one of the following five types of advice:,•	Raising finance and managing cash flow,•	Marketing, attracting and keeping customers,•	Making the most of digital technology,•	Improving leadership and management skills,•	Recruiting and developing staff,At Stage 4, businesses select a supplier from the list of registered providers on an online marketplace.,This online portal is managed by Enterprise Nation. It contains hundreds of suppliers of expert advice in each of the five areas above. Suppliers are selected based on their experience, qualifications and membership of organisations recognised for setting the standards for advice on these important topics. ,Some of the providers in the marketplace also offer advice on a much wider range of topics that can help businesses grow. ,Stage 5 requires businesses to make arrangements to receive their selected advice. It is essential at this stage that the business agrees a price for the advice and checks whether it is suitable to be subsidized using a Growth Voucher. Vouchers will cover up to half of the cost of advice, up to a maximum of £2,000 (non-inclusive of VAT). Businesses may pay more, if they choose, but the maximum they can claim back is £2,000.,At Stage 6, businesses can submit a claim for their subsidy. They will have to provide evidence that the invoice has been paid and details of the advice they received. Claims will be processed on receipt and paid within 30 days.,There are three main treatments in this RCT:  ,•	Personal business advice assessment,•	Online business advice assessment,•	Growth Vouchers,As shown above, all businesses will be sent to the online marketplace.,Treatment allocations map onto the journeys that a business might take through the Growth Vouchers programme.  ,Personal business advice assessment,This is an in-depth assessment conducted with the help of an expert business adviser. Assessments will mostly take place face-to-face but are also available over the telephone and via online voice or video calls. ,Businesses will be able to discuss their plans for growth, current concerns about strategy and so on. They then agree which area of advice is most important for them with their adviser. Advisors will write up an action plan that notes which area of advice was agreed and details some specific next steps. ,The personal business advice assessment is designed to give real value to small businesses, even if they do not receive a Growth Voucher.,Businesses can choose from one of five geographical regions in England, in order to identify the appropriate regional delivery partner for their assessment. Businesses may then contact their delivery partner directly or wait to be contacted in order to arrange an appointment. ,All businesses will be offered an appointment within two weeks of completing their application for the programme.  ,Online business advice assessment,This is a simple, online questionnaire that was developed in conjunction with a number of leading national professional bodies. The questions cover all five areas of advice, so that businesses fully consider the options available to them. ,On completing the questionnaire, businesses will receive a recommendation on the area of advice best suited to them. This recommendation is not be prescriptive – each business may choose to accept it or select a different area of advice. ,Businesses will access the online business advice assessment directly after confirmation that they are eligible to participate in the Growth Vouchers programme. Alternatively, it is accessible via a link that will be emailed to a business should it prefer to complete the assessment later on.,Growth Vouchers ,Businesses may use a Growth Vouchers to claim up to 50% of the cost of any strategic advice, up to a value of £2,000 (non-inclusive of VAT). ,There are effectively five types of Growth Voucher, each valid for only one area of advice: ,•	Growth Voucher for: raising finance and managing cash flow,•	Growth Voucher for: marketing, attracting and keeping customers,•	Growth Voucher for: making the most of digital technology,•	Growth Voucher for: improving leadership and management skills,•	Growth Voucher for: recruiting and developing your staff,That is why Growth Vouchers are only allocated to a business after it selects an area of advice. ,This sequencing and the fact that Growth Vouchers are valid for only one area or advice means that we can analyse whether subsiding advice in one area or another results in a greater return on investment. This is in addition to analysing the impact of offering Growth Vouchers overall. ,Vouchers may be spent only with accredited suppliers for the Growth Vouchers programme. All such suppliers will be registered on the online marketplace hosted by Enterprise Nation. ,To note, businesses that are not given a Growth Voucher will also be directed to the online marketplace but will not receive a subsidy for any advice they purchase.  ,Online Marketplace	,The online marketplace has been developed by the private sector and is hosted by Enterprise Nation. Hundreds of accredited, expert suppliers will be listed and easily identifiable by the Growth Vouchers logo pinned to their profile. ,Businesses will use this portal to identify an appropriate supplier of advice in their specific area. The marketplace cannot be used to process any transactions: businesses will need to contact suppliers themselves, agree a level of advice and arrange to receive it, pay the supplier and then claim their subsidy by redeeming their Growth Voucher. ,Businesses will be encouraged to leave feedback on their chosen supplier, which should help others judge whether a given supplier is likely to offer a good service and value for money. ",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000227,Behavioural Insights Ethics System,2014-01-27,,"January 28, 2014",,,,,,,,,EC2014001

Practices that met minimum EHR use requirements ,received payments on a graduated scale, increasing for more use of EHR functions. ,Methods,The demonstration was implemented in four sites, targeting practices with 20 or fewer providers supplying primary care to at least 50 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The demonstration was expected to operate for five years (June 1, 2009–May 31, 2014), but was cancelled in August 2011 because 43% of the practices did not meet program requirements. The evaluation used a stratified, experimental design—412 treatment and 413 control practices—to estimate the impacts of the payments on adoption and use of EHR functionalities. ,Results,In June 2011, treatment group practices were, on average, 9 to 18 percentage points more likely than control group practices to report using 13 EHR functionalities queried at baseline (2008). The payments increased a summary score of EHR use, which ranged from 1 to 100, by more than 11 points on average relative to the control group (54 versus 43). ,Conclusion,Moderate incentive payments did not lead to universal EHR adoption and use in a two-year time frame. However, the demonstration showed that incentives can influence physician use of EHRs. These results are encouraging regarding the potential effectiveness of the EHR Medicare Incentive Program but also suggest that meaningful use of EHRs on a national scale may take longer than anticipated. ",

"The training provided is the ILO’s Gender and Entrepreneurship Together – GET Ahead for Women in Enterprise program. This program “differs from conventional business training materials by highlighting essential entrepreneurial skills from a gender perspective, whether applied to starting or improving an individual, family or group business. It addresses the practical and strategic needs of low-income women in enterprise by strengthening their basic business and people management skills. It shows women how to develop their personal entrepreneurial traits and obtain support through groups, networks and institutions dealing with enterprise development” (Bauer et al, 2004).  The program began in Thailand in 2001, and over the next decade was used in 18 countries around the developing world. ,An objective of the program is to create a “business mind” among low-income women engaged in small-scale businesses. The training methodology is participatory, with practical exercises to teach concepts. For example, women learn about the different types of costs involved in production, and how to account for their own costs through making lemonade; have role play exercises to practice different sales strategies for customers; and make necklaces to discuss a production process and the importance of different factors in product design. ,Topics covered included several gender concepts that tend not be emphasized in general business training programs such as: the difference between sex and gender, and the role of cultural constraints in shaping women in business; dividing household and business tasks; and how to network with other women and the role of women’s associations. In addition, it covers a number of topics more typical of standard programs such as recordkeeping and bookkeeping; separating business and household finances; marketing; financial concepts; costing and pricing; generating and fine-tuning new business ideas; setting smart objectives; and traits needed for business success. ,The workshop lasts 5 days, and is taught to a group of 20-30 women at a time.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000287,"Maseno University Ethics Review Committee,Innovations for Poverty Action ","2013-03-01,2013-02-13",,"February 21, 2014",,,,,,,,,"MSU/DRPC/MUERC/000006/13,13February-002"

We provide additional evidence on the possible effect of such programs by describing the results of a randomized field experiment whose main purpose was to increase the use of contraceptive methods in rural areas of Ethiopia. In the experiment, administrative areas were randomly allocated to one of three intervention groups or to a fourth control group. In the first intervention group, both credit and family planning services were provided and the credit officers also provided information on family planning. Only credit or family planning services, but not both, were provided in the other two intervention groups, while areas in the control group received neither type of service. Using pre- and post-intervention surveys, we find that neither type of program, combined or in isolation, led to an increase in contraceptive use that is significantly greater than that observed in the control group. We conjecture that the lack of impact has much to do with the mismatch between women’s preferred contraceptive method (injectibles) and the contraceptives provided by community-based agents (pills and condoms).",

Potential receiving schools are those with the lowest achievement in the district, based on school-average test scores in the most recent year, and, in some cases, rankings on school accountability. The rare exceptions that are already participating in a comparable intervention are exempted. The rest of the schools in the district are potential sending schools. ,The third step is recruitment of (1) eligible high-performing teachers in sending schools, whom we refer to as “transfer candidates,” and, simultaneously, (2) principals of receiving schools. The highest-performing teachers (identified in the first step) in potential sending schools are offered a series of transfer incentive payments, totaling $20,000 over two years, to transfer into and remain in one of the receiving schools in their district. The offer is made to these teachers, known as “transfer candidates,” in the spring, at which point they are invited to apply to the program. ,At the same time, principals of potential receiving schools are invited to an information session and asked to identify likely teaching vacancies in targeted grades and subjects. To be considered for inclusion in TTI, principals must volunteer a vacancy. Eligibility is based on grade level and subject of the vacancy. A site manager in each district helps principals fill the targeted vacancies by providing information about transfer candidates and arranging and encouraging interviews. This extra hiring support is in addition to the TTI transfer incentive.,Next, applicants must interview with and be offered a position by the receiving-school principal and then voluntarily transfer to qualify for the transfer incentive. To improve the probability of matching high-performing teachers with low-achieving schools, the implementation team works with each district to finalize offers and acceptances by early summer.,Finally, the transfer teachers participate in a half-day orientation just before the start of the school year. Because they are selected on the basis of their performance in the classroom, it is assumed that they do not require additional formal support beyond what teachers normally receive. To facilitate the transition, however, the site manager provides informal support and answers any questions throughout the two school years of the intervention period. TTI teachers who fill study-assigned vacancies receive their first incentive payment after the orientation, and those who remain during the intervention period in the positions into which they transferred receive incentive payments in December and June, for a total of $20,000.,Teachers who are identified as highest-performing but who are already teaching in low-achieving (potential receiving) schools are not eligible to transfer, but they are offered a retention stipend of $10,000 for staying at their schools over the same two-year period as transfer teachers.,*Value-added measures seek to describe the contribution that teachers make (the value that they add) to student achievement growth, holding constant factors outside the teacher’s control, such as student background and prior learning (McCaffrey et al. 2004; Lipscomb et al. 2010).,Lipscomb, Stephen, Bing-ru Teh, Brian Gill, Hanley Chiang, and Antoniya Owens. “Teacher and Principal Value-Added: Research Findings and Implementation Practices.” Cambridge, MA: Mathematica Policy Research, September 2010.,McCaffrey, Dan F., J.

"Al Amana, the largest Moroccan microfinance organization, opened around 60 new branches in non-densely populated rural areas of Morocco between 2006 and 2007. This expansion of microcredit into previously un-served areas created a favorable context for the use of an experimental methodology to evaluate the impact of the access to microcredit. Among the new villages now covered by Al Amana, 81 sites or “pairs” located at the periphery of the catchment area of 47 new branches were included in the study. Within each pair, the village to receive microcredit services just after the branch opening and the village to be served two years later were randomly selected. ,In treatment villages, credit agents started to promote microcredit and to provide loans immediately after the baseline survey. They visited villages once a week and performed various promotional activities: door-to-door campaigns, meetings with current and potential clients, contact with village associations, cooperatives and women's centers, etc. The main product Al Amana offers in rural areas is a group-liability loan. Disbursed amounts range from 1,000 to 15,000 MAD (124 to 1,855 USD) per member. It can take three to 18 months to reimburse loans, through payments made weekly, twice a month, or monthly. For animal husbandry, a two-month grace period is granted.

"In Haut-Katanga district, the 96 health areas (totalizing 152 health facilities and a catchment population close to two millions) were randomly assigned to one of two payment systems. ,- In the fixed payment group, the amount allocated to each facility was calculated based on the staff in the facility: a list of eligible workers was established at the beginning of the pilot conjointly by Ministry of Health; each worker received a given payment depending on his/her grade and experience. ,- In contrast, payments to the PBF health facilities were to be made after verification of declared service volumes by facilities. The targeted services included seven services at the primary care level (outpatient first curative consultations, prenatal consultations, deliveries, obstetric referral, children completely vaccinated, tetanus toxoid vaccination, and family planning consultations) and three additional services at the secondary care level (C-section, blood transfusion, and obstetric referrals to hospitals).,In order to ensure neutrality in the level of financing between the two groups and isolate the incentive effect from the resource effect, the total budget allocated to health facilities in the PBF group was the same as the total budget allocated to health facilities in the fixed payment group. The relative prices attached to the targeted services were constant, but absolute prices and facility payments were determined by the quantity of services provided by the facility relative to the quantity of services provided by the other incentivized health facilities in order to keep the total enveloppe constant. The budget used in this experiment estimated at $0.43 per capita per year.,Service volumes were measured by use of monthly reports submitted by facilities, in which the number of patients for each targeted service was reported. Subsequently verification of declared service volumes was conducted by verification agents through (i) comparing reported volumes with those found in health facility registers, and (ii) verifying that the information noted in the registers was true by conducting community verification: a random sample of 30 patients in registers were selected and visited by independent associations to check the accuracy of the information reported in the facility register. Community verifications were meant to take place only in the PBF group as part of the financing mechanism. However, we conducted community verifications in the fixed payment health facilities for impact evaluation purposes (1 community verification by facility in the comparison group). The fixed payment health facilities had no incentive to cheat on service volumes so the comparison of discrepancy rates between the PBF and the fixed payment groups allow for differentiating cheating from natural -unavoidable- discrepancies due to the fact that some patients moved or were absent at the time of the verification. A system of financial sanctions was integrated in order to reduce providers’ incentives to submit fraudulent reports and over-reporting of phantom patients.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000386,,,,"May 17, 2014",,,,,,,,,

"The project analyzes the role of information dissemination regarding new technologies and more efficient agricultural practices, and the potential bottlenecks extension services might face in their role of bridging the distance between the research institutions and the local farmers. We consider an ICRAF program targeting dairy producers in Uganda. The farmer trainer (FT) program focuses on dissemination of a set of practices to improve animal feeds and use them more efficiently. EADD trains volunteer farmer trainers, who in turn train other farmers in the production and use of the high-value animal feeds and feeding practices. ,This study is aimed at estimating the overall impact of EADD farmer Trainer approach, as well as analyzing the impact of different variations of the Farmer to Farmer (FTF) extension approach.  Three program variations are considered (the details may be changed as the study unfolds): First, in order to account for beneficiary heterogeneity a variation on customization of extension advice will be conducted. Here it is proposed that selected FTs will be trained to conduct needs assessment with their trainees and help them build individual action plans, focusing their effort on technologies / practices that are more appropriate to them. The second experimental variation, aimed at improving the quality of the information, will establish linkages of FTs with extension professionals who can provide tutoring and expert advice to FTs and monitor their activities. Finally, the third variation will focus on increasing FT incentives.

"We will evaluate the impact on uptake of VMMC of three different postcard-based VMMC recruitment mechanisms relative to a basic VMMC postcard (which will contain basic information about the participating VMMC facilities). The three main VMMC recruitment mechanisms are:,(i)	A transport voucher for R100 conditional upon completing a VMMC consultation at one of the listed participating VMMC facilities, ,(ii)	Information that ‘2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men’, and,(iii)	The statement, “Are you tough enough?” ,All postcards, including the basic VMMC postcard, will include a voucher for light refreshments, conditional on completing a VMMC consultation. This provides an incentive for participants to bring in their postcard if they choose to visit a participating VMMC clinic, which will allow us to measure the effect of each type of postcard on take-up of the VMMC consultation relative to the basic VMMC postcard. All postcards will include a list of participating VMMC facilities (CHAPS has VMMC clinics in 75% of health facilities in the area, thus the list should provide a facility that is accessible to all postcard recipients). ,An overlapping design will be implemented, such that there will be six unique postcards:,Postcard 1: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),Postcard 2: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),Postcard 3: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),Postcard 4: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),Postcard 5: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),Postcard 6: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation),One thousand postcards per treatment arm, and thus 6000 postcards in total (across all 6 arms) will be hand-distributed by CHAPS outreach workers to households in Soweto, Gauteng, with random assignment of each type of postcard to households based on a random-walk sampling algorithm. ,In addition to the aforementioned details, all postcards will contain a phone number and instructions for sending a SMS to the specified number should recipients want to receive more information from an advice nurse, who will make a follow-up call within 2 days of receiving the SMS (the postcard will inform recipients that they will receive a follow-up call from an advice nurse within 2 days of sending their message).

"The main purpose of the program is to overcome search barriers, facilitating new matches and ideally cutting out the middlemen who profligate along the supply chain in the presence of information frictions.  To achieve this, we are fielding a multi-pronged intervention:,1.	AgriNet CAs:  We will train and certify 210 Commission Agents from AgriNet.  These are individuals who are already existing agricultural traders in the treatment communities, but as a part of the project they will be given training in how to work inside the AgriNet model, including how to bulk and quality grade, how to interact with AgriNet’s head office to facilitate transactions, how to use Cash on Bag credit, and how to use the new digital trading platform.,2.	Kudu trading platform:  We will dramatically scale up Kudu, a digital platform written by computer scientists at Makerere University that allows buyers to post bids, sellers (CAs) to post asks, and then performs a back-end matching on crop, price, and distance to identify the three ‘best’ sales lots for each bidder.  The system sends these lots by SMS to the buyer; if the buyer is interested in pursuing a purchase then she calls AgriNet who facilitate the transaction and collect a 10% commission on the sale, to be split between the CA, the Network Manager, and AgriNet headquarters.,3.	Price Information:  We will implement an ‘SMS Blast’ system that will use push SMS to saturate a randomized subset of the treatment areas with information on local prices, national prices, prices currently available through the Kudu platform, and how to contact the CA to arrange for Kudu transactions.  The numbers used for this will be harvested from the baseline household and trader surveys, as well as from the business relationships of the CAs themselves.  The SMS blast system will be randomized at the individual level among farmers in the household baseline to create variation in exposure to information.  There are five information types in the SMS Blast system:  ,a.	‘Downstream’ price information:  price information for your local market, the local hub, and the local superhub.  This is expected to be particularly salient for farmers, because it gives them a sense of the margins their local traders are making, but it will be sent to CAs and non-CA traders as well.,b.	‘Random Blast’ price information:  each week we will randomly sample five treatment TCs and circulate price information on these markets to the entire treatment set of CAs, traders, and buyers.,c.

Kudu price information: sent to those receiving the Kudu Promotional information,e.	Extra AgriNet price information such as FIT-Uganda prices for markets all across the country, to be sent only to CAs.  ,Then, there are four types of users who will receive the SMS Blast:,a.	CAs:  all CAs will receive price information at high frequency through the Blast system.,b.	Farmers:  3/4s of farmers in treatment TCs surveyed in the baseline who have mobile phones will receive the SMS Blast.  The remaining 1/4th of these farmers will receive no messages through the SMS Blast system, to create household-level variation.  Control TC farmers receive no SMS information.,c.	Non-CA Traders.  ,d.	Buyers.,4.	Transport Guarantees:  We will use project funds to introduce two types of randomized guarantees to the Kudu system.   These guarantees are aimed at mitigating the impact of contractual risk for buyers, thereby inducing them to accept deals for which the risk would otherwise be too great.  The randomization occurs at the level of the Kudu sales match; meaning that each time a buyer enters the system and is matched to sellers there will be an independent randomization as whether that bundle of contracts receives a guarantee.  There are two levels of guarantee:  the Basic Guarantee, which covers the buyer against any shortfalls in quantity that occur when they arrive in the village to buy, and the Comprehensive Guarantee which additionally covers against shortfalls in quality or attempts by the seller to renegotiate price.  The cost of the guarantees during the pilot phase will be covered by a grant from IGC.  38% of sales matches will receive the Basic and 15% the Comprehensive Guarantee.  The guarantees reimburse buyer losses according to a distance-related percentage:,a.	0-100 km:  	25%,b.	100-200 km: 	50%,c.	200-300 km: 	75%,d.	300+ km:	100%,Losses are calculated relative to the contract terms as agreed before the buyer set out, and the specific losses covered are as per the type of guarantee.  The fact that the reimbursements are a discontinuous function of distance allows us to use Regression Discontinuity to assess the impact of transport risk on buyer willingness to transact.,5.	Trader Credit: Cash on Bag (COB) is a service for extending credit to CAs, who in turn may use this credit to pay cash-constrained farmers for 50% of the value of their crop upon bulking with the CAs and 50% upon sale to the buyer.  It is designed to allow CAs to bulk a greater volume from a larger number of traders and thereby engage in more trade.  We will randomize the allocation of Cash on Bag (COB) credit among the 60 most reliable CAs in the AgriNet system, whereby 30 will randomly receive credit and 30 will not.  This randomization will be done at the subcounty level to prevent spillovers from treated to untreated CAs.  Credit will be delivered at the beginning of the harvest season to be used for trading throughout that season.  The expectation is that CAs can make 6 successive transactions within a season with the COB credit, and their use of it will be overseen by (and guaranteed by) the Network Managers.,The study is focusing on four crops:  maize, dried nambale beans, matooke bananas, and tomatoes.   The first two are the primary storable food crops in Uganda and are major export crops; matooke bananas are the core subsistence food across most of southern Uganda, and tomatoes are the most heavily traded highly perishable crop in the country. ",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000749,"Uganda National Council on Science and Technology,University of California Human Research Protections Program","2014-04-07,2014-05-08",,"June 28, 2015",,,,,,,,,"SS 3541,140744"
"The first stage of this experiment (Stage 1) aims to quantify competition among traders in agricultural markets.  It does so by offering a marginal cost subsidy and identifying what percentage of this subsidy is passed through to the price at which traders sell to customers.  This pass-through is then combined with estimates of demand elasticity to yield a competitiveness parameter.  The second stage of the experiment (Stage 2) measures the impact of new traders entering the market on competitiveness.

"Firms were randomly assigned to the target groups for the two interventions or to a control group. One of the interventions consisted of workshops run by CCB instructors. The CCB invites informal-sector entrepreneurs to these workshops so that it can provide them with information about the advantages and disadvantages of operating formally. It also provides information about the registration process. The workshop lasted two hours and then allowed for additional time to provide more information about the registration process to interested entrepreneurs. The person in charge of providing this information to the entrepreneurs then contacted them by telephone in order to arrange a meeting at the CCB to start off the registration procedure. This follow-up support began at the time that the entrepreneur expressed interest in registration after the workshop and ended when the firm obtained its business license. ,The second intervention consisted of personalized visits to interested firms by CCB agents who gave them the same information that was imparted at the workshop and assisted them with the registration process if they wished to have that type of support.

"Our design is simple, and builds on the evolved wisdom of the ROSCA idea: in short, we replicate the rotating structure of a ROSCA in an individual-liability product. This combines saving and credit into a single financial service, offered to individuals (rather than groups), and tests whether microcredit demand is motivated by savings needs.,Experimental treatments vary the type of contract offered to participants. Contracts differ by (i) timing of lump sum payment and (ii) interest rate. Assuming a product cycle of six weeks, lump sum payments are either made on week 1 or week 6 (where ‘week 1’ refers to the week immediately following the week of the offer). On any week that the lump sum is not paid, the participant is required to pay a fixed amount. The base lump sum payment is either smaller (that is, a negative interest rate), equal to (zero nominal interest rate) or larger than (positive interest) the sum of weekly fixed amounts paid.,We there have two treatments, which together can be combined in six different ways (that is, there are three possible interest rates and two possible weeks for lump sum payment). Each participant in the experiment is randomly offered one of these contracts, and must make a ‘take it or leave it’ decision whether to accept. We are interested to test (i) whether there is demand for this kind of rotating individual-liability product, and (ii) if so, how that demand varies with the terms of the contract randomly offered.,The proposed study will represent a novel and important contribution to the existing literature on microfinance under two main respects. First, almost no research in this literature considers directly the trade-off between microcredit and microsaving; that is, almost no literature studies the extent to which savings and credit may operate as substitute methods for easing credit constraints. One notable exception is the recent work of Kast and Pomeranz (2013), who show some evidence that reducing barriers to savings lowers borrowing among microfinance clients in Chile. The proposed study, by evaluating a product that embodies both savings and credit components, will be able to directly test the degree of complementarity or substitutability of credit and savings for different types of individuals. Second, while there is some suggestion that the formalisation of informal savings products can have large advantages for the poor (Dupas and Robinson, 2012), no previous research has tested directly whether the rotating structure of a ROSCA can viably be implemented as an individual microfinance product. The proposed study, by reproducing the structure of a ROSCA within an individual liability product, can test the viability of formalising one of the most common informal savings tool in the developing world, and evaluate its impact.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000684,Lahore School of Economics Research Ethics Review Committee,2015-05-07,,"May 10, 2015",,,,,,,,,RERC-042015-02

"“Incentivizing Savings” is a randomized impact evaluation that is currently taking place in the Metropolitan Region, Chile, executed by J-PAL LAC, institution based in the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in partnership with BancoEstado, a state-owned, autonomous financial institution. The investigation aims to determine and compare the effect of different saving incentives, as saving reminders through cell phone text messages (SMS) and automatic savings plans, in variables like financial inclusion and general well-being of the individuals. A more specific description of the treatments is presented below:,•	Treatment 1: Automatic savings plan. This treatment consists in the offering of an automatic savings program.,•	Treatment 2: Reminder text messages. This group receives one text message per month, recalling their savings target mentioned in the baseline survey. ,•	Treatment 3: Short Training. A four-part treatment, it begins with a 3 minutes animated video with strategies that could eventually help people to lower their consumption in Temptation goods. Second, a pack is given to those assigned to this treatment with a magnet and a card holder with the logo of the project as ""reminders"".  Third, a book that insists in the strategies is given to the participants assigned to this treatment. To increase the retention of the books, they are made as calendars. And fourth, SMSs is sent every month with the strategies mentioned in the video. ,•	Control group: People in this group just open a savings account. ,The sample was arranged with BancoEstado, an institution with a strong presence in the whole territory, and consists of BancoEstado clients (over 18 years old) recruited in the branches when the Bank executives inform them about the investigation and then offer them to participate. The branches have been chosen considering their vulnerability; the poorer municipalities of the Metropolitan Region. The number of people being considered is 6,000; 1,800 in the Control group, 1,800 in Treatment 1, 1,200 in Treatment 2 and 1,200 in Treatment 3. ,As mentioned, the participants are recruited in the branches once they approach the Bank executives with the intention of opening a saving account. Once the clients mention their intention to open a savings account, the executive offers them to participate. If they agree, the executives must handle them the written consent, wait for them to sign it and then handle the baseline survey, which is performed in a tablet device provided by the research team that includes also a presentation video. The randomization and subsequent treatment assignment is made by the same survey software using the last digit of the RUT number (the National Identification Number that is correlated only with the order of birth registration in a short period of time and not related with any socioeconomic or personal characteristic) that was filled as the first question of the survey.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000792,Innovations for Poverty Action Institutional Review Board,2015-05-12,,"July 29, 2015",,,,,,,,,12105

"Recent research has shown that social pressure, peer comparisons, and other non-price interventions can increase pro-social behaviors across a variety of domains. Such “behavioral interventions” have become more common in recent years with the popularity of the book Nudge (Sunstein and Thaler 2008) and the rising prominence of “nudge units” in the UK and US governments. Typically, these interventions are evaluated primarily on how they affect a given behavioral outcome, such as volunteering, charitable donations, job choice and effort, or environmental conservation. Policymakers use these impact evaluations to compare the cost effectiveness of different interventions.,This standard approach ignores a central policy question: what are the welfare impacts of pro-social behavioral interventions? DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier (2012) ask this question in the context of charitable giving, pointing out that donation could increase utility, for example by activating warm glow, or decrease utility, for example if giving occurs due to social pressure. Their welfare calculations show that door-to-door fund raising drive lowered overall utility, even as it raised funds for charity. This result highlights that the impact of a pro-social intervention on the intended behavior is an incomplete, and potentially misleading, measure of whether an intervention should be scaled up.,Our paper asks a similar question in a very different context: what are the welfare effects of providing energy use social comparisons to encourage energy conservation? In recent years, electric and natural gas utilities and their regulators have become increasingly interested in “behavioral en- ergy efficiency.” Because carbon taxes and similar externality pricing mechanisms can be politically infeasible, energy conservation programs including behavioral interventions have been implemented as a substitute. Some “behavioral” energy conservation interventions are also thought to address non-externality market failures, for example by informing consumers about their energy use and ways to conserve. Perhaps the most salient example of such an intervention is the “home energy report,” as popularized by several providers, including a company called Opower. Home energy reports containing social comparisons, conservation messaging, and energy use tips are now being sent to more than six million households across the United States, and their use continues to expand domestically and abroad.,There has been significant academic interest in home energy report interventions, beginning with studies by Nolan et al. (2008) and Schultz et al. (2007), and hundreds of follow-on studies of similar interventions. These studies clearly establish that such interventions can cause consumers to reduce energy use, and many interpret this finding as evidence that policymakers should further implement the programs. However, no study has asked whether these interventions increase welfare. Do people conserve because they are better-informed and inspired, or because they feel guilty? More broadly, do the social comparisons act like a welfare-increasing psychic subsidy on energy conservation or welfare-reducing psychic tax on energy use? The home energy reports are empirically convenient for two reasons: first, they are a private good which can be sold to consumers, and second, it is standard to deliver them to consumers repeatedly over several years. These two features mean that it is possible and relevant to measure willingness to pay for continued reports, in a sample of experienced recipients.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000713,"INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD - University of Pennsylvania,University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects - New York University","2015-01-05,2014-11-21",,"June 12, 2015",,,,,,,,,"#821688 - Relying on NYU's IRB status,IRB# 14-10392 - Exempt status"

Are there potential high-growth entrepreneurs with the ability to grow their firms beyond this size? And, if so, can public policy help alleviate the constraints that prevent these entrepreneurs from doing so? A large-scale national business plan competition in Nigeria is used to help provide evidence on these two questions. The competition was launched with much fanfare, and attracted almost 24,000 entrants. Random assignment was used to select some of the winners from a pool of semi-finalists, with US$36 million in randomly allocated grant funding providing each winner with an average of almost US$50,000. Surveys tracking applicants over three years show that winning the business plan competition leads to greater firm entry, higher survival of existing businesses, higher profits and sales, and higher employment, including increases of over 20 percentage points in the likelihood of a firm having 10 or more workers. These effects appear to occur largely through the grants enabling firms to purchase more capital and hire more labor. ",

Headspace offers straightforward, guided, bite-sized mindfulness training that is non-religious. We have signed guarantees with Headspace that participant data collected through Headspace will never be sold, distributed, or publicised (except anonymously in scientific publications with Headspace having no involvement in the conduct, analysis, or reporting of the research in any way).  ,Participants will be sent an email introducing Headspace and describing the sign-up process.  To get started, participants are required to register on headspace.com using their name and email address.  Each participant will be given a unique code providing free access to Headspace for the duration of the study. It is through the provision of these codes that randomisation will be achieved. This will be done automatically using an online process described below in Section 3. In this way, group allocation will be double-blinded. After registering, participants may begin meditating straight away.  ,The proposed intervention is 6-weeks in length.  Participants will be encouraged to practice meditation daily for the course of the 6-weeks using materials from the Foundation Pack which includes 30 x 10 minute sessions introducing the concept and practice of mindfulness training.  Guided throughout, each session gradually builds on the previous one.  ,Primary and secondary measures will be taken at baseline, at the end of the intervention and at 3 months following the end of the intervention. Manipulation checks will be carried out during weeks 2 and 4 of the intervention. In terms of primary outcome measures, we will assess critical thinking using the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment (Halpern, 2010) and items from the Heuristics and Biases literature (West, Toplak, & Stanovich, 2008), mindfulness with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006), thinking dispositions with the Need for Cognition scale (Cacciopo & Petty, 1982) and the Actively Open Minded thinking scale (Stanovich & West, 1997) and executive function with the Sternberg working memory task (Sternberg, 1975) presented on Inquisit software (Draine, 2004; demo at www.millisecond.com/download/library/Sternberg/). Objective measures of meditation adherence (no. of sessions initiated and completed and no. of minutes spent meditating) will be gathered through the Headspace app. Secondary measures will assess effects on wellbeing in order to compare with previous studies employing Headspace. The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson & Clark, 1994) and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (Tennant et al., 2007) will be used. Manipulation checks will focus on mindfulness meditation quality and task expectations, enjoyment and difficulty. Participants will be asked to complete these measures directly following completion of a meditation exercise. Mindfulness meditation quality will be assessed using the 6 item Practice Quality- Mindfulness questionnaire (Del Re et al., 2013) while task expectations, enjoyment and difficulty will be assessed using the Health Information Technology Acceptance questionnaire (Kim & Park, 2012). ,We intend to submit the protocol describing the rationale and procedure for this study to the open access journal BMC Psychology for peer review and publication. When data analysis is complete and the results are written up, we intend to submit our findings to the same journal. All stakeholders (e.g. participants, funding body) will then have full, free access to the protocol, results and peer reviews (as BMC Psychology employs open peer review).",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000756,NUI Galway Research Ethics Committee,2015-09-11,,"September 14, 2015",,,,,,,,,(15/ Sept/03)

"      The experiment consists of 18 sessions, which are computerized using the z-Tree software package (Fischbacher, 2007). Both the instructions and the game information shown on the computer screen are in Chinese. In each session, we randomly assign subjects to groups of four; our sample consist of 64 groups in total. ,      The experiment includes two stages: The first stage comprises twelve periods, whereas the second one comprises eight periods. Group members do not change within each stage but subjects are randomly reshuffled into groups of four after the first stage; this rule is made to be common information. The subjects are not told the exact number of periods in each stage. Instead, the subjects are told that the experiment would last from 30 minutes to one hour, including the time for sign-up, reading of instructions, taking a quiz designed to ensure that subjects understand the experimental rule, and final payment. We note two features of this design. First, we want to reduce the possibility of backward induction.  Second, our study design approximates features of real-world situations. In many real-world cases, people do not know the exact number of coordination opportunities. ,      At the beginning of each period, subjects know the stake of the current period but not those of future periods. This condition replicates the circumstances of many real-world cases, in which people do not know what is at stake in future interactions.  ,      In each period, we endow each subject with 20 points and ask each to give a certain number of points to the common pool of his/her assigned group. The required number could vary across periods, and each subject could only choose either “to give the exact points required” (we use the natural term “give” rather than “contribute” in the instruction), which we refer to as stake, or “not to give” at all. If all members in a group contribute, then each member not only receives the stake back, but also gains an extra return, which equals the stake. If not all group members contribute, then each member finishes the period with only his/her remaining points (i.e., the initial endowment in each period minus the contribution of the subject).  ,      At the end of each period, each subject knows whether all four group members (including himself/herself) contributed the stake for that period but did not know the total number of group members who contributed (in case fewer than four members contributed). This design is consistent with the standard design in the literature of minimum-effort coordination games (e.g., Van Huyck et al., 1990), in which the only commonly available historical data to players is the minimum contribution of group members. By adopting this design we can also increase the difficulty of coordination given other aspects of the experiment, and study whether gradualism can help overcome such a difficulty.,       The final total payment to each player equals the accumulated earnings over all periods plus a show-up fee. The exchange rate is 40 points per CNY 1. An average subject earned CNY 21–22 (around USD 3) including the show-up fee for the whole experiment, which covers ordinary meals for one to two days on campus. With regard to the purchasing power, this payment is comparable to those experiments conducted in other countries. ,       Our experiment comprises four treatments: (1) Big Bang, (2) Semi-Gradualism, (3) Gradualism, and (4) a variant of the Big Bang treatment, which we call the High Show-up Fee treatment. All groups in the three main treatments face the same stake in the second half (Periods 7–12) of the first stage, but stake paths differ for each treatment in the first half (Periods 1–6). The first half of the first stage feature different stake paths for each treatment. The different stake paths might yield potential earning differences and could potentially lead to a wealth effect across treatments. To isolate the wealth effect on the contribution of participants from the effect of the three main treatments in the second half of the first stage, we introduce the High Show-up Fee treatment, which is a variant of the Big Bang treatment. We randomly assign 12 subjects into the three main treatments for 8 of the 18 sessions. In the remaining 10 sessions, we randomly assign 16 subjects into the four treatments (three main treatments and one supplementary High Show-up Fee treatment). In total, we have 18, 18, 18, and 10 groups in Big Bang, Semi-Gradualism, Gradualism, and High Show-up Fee treatments, respectively.

"The Department of Labor and Empoyment implemented the Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) by enacting Republic Act 7323 (Special Program for the Employment of Students), in 1992, to help poor but deserving students pursue their education by encouraging employment during summer and/or Christmas vacations, through incentives granted to employers. The objectives of SPES are to: augment income to cover the costs of education through an employment bridging program; keep youth in school and finish education where employers pay 60% of the beneficiaries and government (through DOLE) pays 40%; and increase school retention and graduation rate of the target beneficiaries. For 20-52 working days, students and out-of-school youth (OSY) who are 15-25 years old may apply for SPES, provided they are poor but deserving students who want to pursue education. To participate in the program, family income (including the applicant’s) may not exceed the regional poverty threshold for a family of six (6); the applicant must have obtained an average passing grade during the previous term or school year; the applicant must show good moral character as certified by the Barangay Chairman in their area; and the applicant must intend to enroll in any secondary, tertiary or tech-vocational educational institution.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000949,,,,"November 16, 2015",,,,,,,,,

"The “Groupement de Créateurs” program is proposed to young people aged 18 to 25, who already have the project to create a business, an association or any new activity within an existing firm or association. ,The support program has three phases. During the ""Emergence phase"", lasting between 2 to 8 months, the participants confirm their desire of carrying out their project. They learn to know themselves better: their motivations, strengths and weaknesses. They begin to talk and write about their project and confront it to external opinions. They also work on defining their project more precisely and determine what they need to achieve it. The support consists in regular individual interviews (about every 2 weeks) and collective workshops. The aim of this phase is to stimulate dynamism and autonomy, which are useful even if the project is abandoned in the end. ,For the young people who confirm a desire of achieving their project in the short term, they can participate in the second phase, the Training phase which takes place within a University. This  6 months academic program leads to a technical degree in entrepreneurship. The third phase is the creation of the business, the association or any other kind of activity. During the entire program, the main role of the counselor is to pass on a method of making decision, that will be used by the young people for any project they will have to conduct. The counselor doesn’t interfere in the technical dimensions of the project, the technical expertise being provided by other actors who are specialized in entrepreneurial consulting.,A random half of the volunteers to participate in the program have been included in the test group, while the other half have been included in the control group. Both groups have had access to trainings and other programs in favour of entrepreneurship. The Emergence phase and its collective workshops remains specific to the test group. The evaluation concerns 902 young people (recruited during 29 months starting in November 2010): 468 young people are beneficiaries of the program while 434 have been included in the control group (and can benefit from other programs, except the ""Groupement de Créateurs"").",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000391,J-PAL Europe,2013-01-03,,"August 17, 2014",,,,,,,,,CE/2012-003
"Randomly-selected federal student loan applicants in Chile received information about institution- and major-specific earnings and debt outcomes as part of the 2013 online loan application process. In addition, we conduct a survey asking students six questions on enrollment plans and expectations about earnings and cost outcomes. Survey responses were collected from treatment and control groups. Survey response data supplements administrative data and allows us to test predictions about the impact of the information treatment based on a model of enrollment choice with limited information. We use administrative data to track students in the treatment and control groups and identify whether and where they chose to enroll.,We administered the survey and field experiment in partnership with the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC). Directly following the submission of student loan applications, students were sent an email from MINEDUC requesting that they log into a secure website to fill out an additional set of questions. Applicants logged in, accepted an informed consent statement, and were asked six questions. These included questions about enrollment plans, questions about own earnings and tuition cost expectations at the degree programs where the student was considering enrolling, and questions about expected earnings for typical students at those degree programs. 49,166 students completed the online survey. ,Upon completing the survey, randomly-selected students continued to two additional web pages designed to provide information about and prompt search for degrees with higher returns for past graduates. Our web application used prior survey responses to display personalized information for each applicant based on our back-end database linking educational and tax records for past graduates. ,The first page displayed information on earnings gains (relative to no tertiary enrollment) in monthly terms for the participant’s first-choice degree, tuition costs in monthly payments, and a “net value” which was the difference between monthly gains and payments in pesos. Costs and benefits were calculated over the 15 year student loan repayment term, and converted into monthly gains and monthly debt payments. To encourage search, the page also displayed how much more net value the applicant could receive by enrolling in an alternative institution offering the same major, or in a different major in the same broad field of study (e.g. nursing vs. nutrition). Potential gains were drawn from degrees relevant to respondents based on the selectivity of their planned enrollment choices. The second page consisted of a searchable database that allowed students to select a major and enter an entrance exam score. Based on that information, the page populated a table of degrees admitting students with similar scores, sorted in descending order by net value. Students were told they could save up to ten search tables and could re-login to view them any time. The web program recorded all searches made.

"Two interventions are proposed for evaluation as part of this study.,First, Operation Quartier Propre (OQP) will engage local Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to work within their communities to improve and maintain the cleanliness of public spaces and drainage infrastructure. CBOs will receive an initial endowment in the form of standard cleaning equipment provided to them through the municipality. After six months, the progress of the CBOs toward achieving an agreed set of targets will be evaluated against a small set of standardized benchmarks, and where acceptable progress has been made the CBO will be rewarded with a plaque or a banner that will be displayed in a public place signaling their involvement and success in maintaining the cleanliness of their community. At the end of the intervention period (after 1 year) CBOs that have fulfilled all criteria will receive in-kind incentives in the form of t-shirts, cooking materials and plastic chairs, and the right to keep the formerly distributed initial endowment (the endowment and incentives were developed through consultations with the implementing agency and their contracted Social Facilitators, which are larger NGOs operating in PROGEP project areas). In addition, a public ceremony will be held to formally acknowledge and reward the CBOs that have been successful.,The second intervention consists of community micro-projects (Projets d’Investissement Communautaire, or PICs), which are investments of US$10-70k applied for and implemented by community-based organizations with a high-level of implementation support and supervision from the Municipal Development Agency of Dakar (PROGEP implementing agency) and the project’s Social Facilitators. PICs are intended to improve the value of areas surrounding water retention ponds through construction e.g. of walk paths, fishing areas, picnic tables, sports infrastructure, etc.; securing unbuildable lands; improving waste management around drainage infrastructure; and decreasing possible negative externalities of drainage infrastructure, such as malaria transmission. ,This registry focuses on the experimental evaluation of the OQP intervention.

"Many interventions designed to reduce poverty fail to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor, suggesting a need for targeted programs.  Working with Bandhan, a microfinance institution based in West Bengal, we conducted baseline and post-program surveys of approximately 1,000 ""ultra-poor"" households.  To be considered ultra-poor, households must meet a set of criteria including having an able-bodied female member and not being associated with any microfinance organization.  In addition, households must meet three out of the five following requirements: primary source of income is informal labor or begging, land holdings are below 20 decimals, household owns no productive asset other than land, no able bodied males in the household, and school-aged children work instead of attending school.  ,Half of the sampled households were randomly selected to participate in Bandhan's ""Targeting the Hard-Core Poor"" (THP) program.  The theory behind the program is that the poor are trapped in extreme poverty by their lack of assets and inability to use financial intermediation to overcome their lack of assets.  Bandhan purchases and distributes assets such as livestock and inventory to program beneficiaries.  The grants are also used to finance other inputs, such as fodder and sheds for livestock.  Bandhan staff meet with participants to select the livelihood option best suited to the household.  In the study sample, 90% of beneficiaries chose livestock, receiving either 2 cows, 4 goats or 1 cow and 2 goats.  The value of the asset transferred was approximately US$100, equivalent to 20% of baseline hosuehold expenditure.,Over the next eighteen months, Bandhan staff meet weekly with beneficiaries.  Staff provide information and training on topics related to the household's enterprise as well as broader social and health issues.  Beneficiaries are also required to save Rs. 10 per week at these meetings.  Eighteen months after receipt of the asset, the beneficiaries are ""graduated"" to microfinance and become eligible for regular microfinance loans provided by Bandhan.  ",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000382,MIT COUHES,2007-04-02,,"July 13, 2015",http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/targeting-hard-core-poor-impact-assessment,,,,,,,"This study reports the results of a randomized impact evaluation of a program designed to reach the poorest of the poor and elevate them out of extreme poverty.

The results of this study, based on a pilot in India, indicate that this intervention succeeds in elevating the economic situation of the poorest. We find that the program results in a 15% increase in household consumption and has positive impacts on other measures of household wealth and welfare, such as assets and emotional well-being. Our results are consistent with the notion that the wealth transfer, in the form of asset distribution, directly increased consumption among beneficiary households through the liquidation of assets, but other sources of income, notably from small enterprises, appear to have contributed to the overall increase in consumption as well.",0701002099

"“We Can Manage!” (WCM) is a village savings and loans association (VSLA) organized by the National Union of Disabled Persons of Uganda (NUDIPU), targeting females and disabled people in rural Uganda. Each group in the association consists of 30 members, where the majority of both management and group members are female or disabled. The group members meet on a weekly basis, where each member saves one to five shares, each share typically worth 2000 Ush (0.8 USD).The saving is recorded in the savings book of the group. There is also saving for an emergency fund, typically 500 Ush per week. Loans are given to group members according to demand and need. NUDIPU helps organize the groups and provides training during the first year, on how to manage the group, savings, and loans, but does not provide any direct financial assistance. ,The savings- and loans cycle is typically one year, after which there is a “share-out”, when all savings and interest payments are divided by the number of shares and paid out. The group then decides on whether to start a new cycle or not. In most cases, they do. VSLAs function like small, unregulated financial institutions, providing members with an accessible source of credit, a safe place to save regularly, and a solidarity fund for emergencies.,VSLAs stimulate savings by offering people a safe place to store their money (in VSLAs, money is stored in a cashbox, locked with three padlocks, and with three different members holding a key to the box, and with the box being stored in the house of a fourth member). The possibility of moving money out of the house, and out of the sight of husbands or other family members, may be an important rationale for joining a savings group (Anderson and Baland, 2002). Perhaps equally important, the VSLAs can serve as a commitment device (in case of hyperbolic preference) and a reminder (a “nudge”) to save (Ashraf, Karlan, Yin, 2006). ,The intervention consists of field promoters from NUDIPU activating the groups assigned to treatment. The activation consisted of a training program and the facilitation of the startup period in the group, including technical assistance, both in terms of how to write a constitution, how to access the saving box and keys (which are provided to the groups at cost-price), and more generally how to run the group.

"In collaboration with Operation ASHA (OpASHA), an Indian NGO that operates 200 community-based DOTS (“Directly Observed Treatment Short Course”) centers in India, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of different types of financial incentives to encourage referrals from current TB patients to new suspects. We will vary (1) the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), (2) whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers (“patient outreach” and “patient provides names” conditions), and (3) whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). ,The “unconditional” incentive will consist of Rupees (Rs.) 150 offered to current patients for each new suspect they induce to come to the center and get tested for TB. When the reward is fixed, each current patient has an incentive to refer any person who may be willing to be tested, irrespective of whether they know or believe they have TB. The “conditional” incentive treatment will consist of Rs. 100 for each new suspect who comes to the center and gets tested, plus a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. Comparison of the effect of conditional and unconditional incentives will allow us to determine whether the subjects take advantage of incentives that do not depend on test results, and whether they have concrete information about their contacts’ health. ,To separate the effect of current patients’ networks from their ability to deliver information and persuade new suspects to get tested, we will vary whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers. In the “patient outreach” treatment, current patients will be given a set of referral cards and will be told that they will receive the reward if new suspects present at the center with the card and get tested for TB; in the “patient provides names” treatment, current patients will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they believe should get tested, and will receive the reward if the new suspect, who will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, comes to the center and gets tested. ,Finally, there will be two versions of the “patient provides names” treatment. In the “known referrer” version, the health workers will reveal to the new suspects who named them, whereas in the “anonymous referrer” version, the name of the referrer will not be revealed to the new suspects. This will allow us to determine the extent to which social stigma is a barrier to referrals. In fact, if social costs are the reason why current patients are reluctant to approach others, anonymity should remove them resulting in more and perhaps more effective referrals.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000773,"Institute of Financial Management and Research ,University of Maryland ","2013-05-29,2013-07-09",,"November 12, 2015",,,,,,,,,"IRB00007107,419706-2"
"Treatment Group 1, Capitation Grant (70 schools): In this group the capitation grant (CG) program, as dictated by the Tanzanian Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, is implemented at each school. Each school receives a grant of 10,000Tsh/student, delivered in two tranches, one in March and one in July. This treatment focuses on making the existing policy work by channeling funds in full and more effectively to primary schools, and to test the effects of basic information provision about the grants. The evaluation will seek to measure the extent to which the funds reach schools, the level of citizen engagement on the use of funds, and ultimately the impact of funds and information on improving learning outcomes. In 2013, the average CG distributed to schools was 7,646,429Tsh.,Treatment Group 2, Cash on Delivery (70 schools): In this group teachers of Kiswahili, English and Math in Grades 1, 2, and 3 are eligible to receive 5,000Tsh per student that passes a given subject test at the end of the year, for a total of 15,000Tsh possible per student. Teachers are not penalized for students who do not pass.,Treatment Group 3, Combination (70 schools): Schools in this treatment group are given both the Capitation Grant and Cash on Delivery intervention.,All interventions were implemented directly by Twaweza and it’s District Partners, with money given through the CG and COD interventions coming also from Twaweza. Within each intervention, information describing the intervention was distributed to schools and the communities via school and community meetings in early-2013. The District Partners then followed up with additional school visits in July and August to answer any questions regarding the program. All students in Grades 1, 2, and 3 in schools in Treatment Groups 2 and 3 were tested in Kiswahili, English and Math at the end of the school year to determine teacher incentive payments.

"We have adapted the poverty primes by Mani et al. (2013) to the MTurk environment. As in Mani et al. (2013), we present our respondents hypothetical scenarios, each of which describes a financial problem. We randomly assign our respondents to either a hard or an easy financial scenario.,In the first financial scenario they need to explain how they would deal with an income decrease of 20% (5%) in the hard (easy) financial scenario. We then ask them a variety of questions on whether this income shock would substantially affect their situation and what kind of sacrifices they would need to make. In the second scenario people explain how they would deal with a situation in which they need to come up with an amount of money: In the hard (easy) financial scenario respondents are asked how they would come up with $3000 ($150) in a short notice. The order with which these financial scenarios is presented is randomized. Respondents write down how they might deal with the financial scenarios. The aim of exposure to these scenarios is to trigger feelings of poverty.,We have made two main changes to the primes used by Mani et al.

We have conducted a pilot study with a sample of 350 participants on August 1st in which we document that our two primes successfully affect financial worries.

"Interventions:  This study will evaluate two interventions, 1) subsidized daycare and 2) subsidized daycare plus quality improvements, using two treatment arms and one comparison group. ,Intervention 1: Subsidized Daycare,The costs of formal daycare can be prohibitively costly to mothers with low earning potential, such as women living in the informal settlement areas of Nairobi.  Subsidizing daycare could lower this barrier to economic engagement and encourage mothers with young children to enter the labor force or work longer hours, thereby increasing their household’s total income. Such support may be particularly beneficial to disadvantaged women such as single mothers and recent immigrants who are expected to have the least social support in helping with their childcare. Women in this arm of our study will receive a full year of vouchers for free daycare services at selected local facilities. Participating daycares will also receive modest monthly cash transfers to compensate them for the additional monitoring and help them accommodate a possible increase in their number of enrolled pupils. ,Intervention 2: Subsidized Daycare at Improve Daycare Facilities,Given the low quality of some daycare centers in the informal settlements, some mothers may be reluctant to place their children in daycares regardless of the costs. To test whether the availability of affordable and high-quality daycares increase women’s engagement with the workforce, we provide quality improvements to half of the daycares we are subsidizing. These quality improvements include the training of all childcare providers in each selected center using an adapted program used by the Aga Khan Foundation, which is based on UNICEF/WHO’s Care for Child Development (C4CD) model, an Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention. The C4CD intervention provides information and recommendations for cognitive stimulation and social support to young children, through sensitive and responsive caregiver-child interactions. The C4CD package guides health workers, caregivers, counsellors, and parents to build stronger relationships with their children, solve problems in caring for their children, and learn how to be sensitive and respond to the needs of the children. Childcare providers will also receive training on nutrition, child security, toy development, hygiene, sanitation, adequate sleep, and record keeping. The training will be covered in 5 full-days (after 2 days of a needs assessment pre-visit by the master trainers). Refresher training would also be offered half way through the intervention period.

"We undertake a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 180 primary schools in Honduras, complemented by qualitative analysis, to estimate the impacts of providing print materials and pedagogical support to maximize teachers’ ability to take advantage of these assessments in early primary grades. To do this, we randomize schools into 3 experimental groups: EOG wrap-around support and FA with support (Group A), EOG wrap-around support only (Group B), and ongoing programming by Honduras’ Ministry of Education (MOE) (Group C, the control group). Group C has limited access to printed FA materials from the Ministry’s previous efforts to distribute them. All schools administer an EOG test, but only schools in Groups A and B receive the intervention’s training and wrap-around support. We collected baseline data in October and November 2014 at the end of the school year. We conducted random assignment in January 2015. The intervention began in June 2015 and we began baseline analysis in June 2015. We follow the cohort of students who were in the second grade in the first year of the 2-year intervention.,This design allows us to answer three main sets of research questions. First, we will compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group A to those in schools assigned to group B. This first comparison allows us to provide unbiased estimates of the impact of the FA intervention, holding constant the EOG wrap-around support intervention. Second, we will compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group B to those in schools assigned to group C.

Third, we will also be able to compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group A to those in schools assigned to group C. This comparison allows us to provide unbiased estimates of the impact of the combined use of EOG wrap-around support and FA with support, compared to the ongoing programming provided by MOE and other organizations.

"We will carry out a psycho-social stimulation programme coupled with nutrition education that aims to improve interactions between mothers or principal caregivers and their infants/children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The programme follows a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. Alternative service provisions include delivery of the curriculum by local women either (i) during weekly individual home visits to mother and child, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly mother-child group meetings.

Provision of education on nutritional issues (hereafter referred to as “NE”):  Regular visits to the home will be carried out by local women hired and trained for the project (henceforth referred to as educators) to deliver the nutritional education curriculum, which will be designed to produce positive changes in food choice, preparation and storage.,2.	Individual Stimulation via Home Visits (IS) (+ NE): Weekly visits to the home will be carried out by local women hired and trained for the project (henceforth referred to as facilitators) to deliver the stimulation curriculum and involve mother and child in play and learning activities. ,3.	Group Stimulation (GS) (+ NE): In this variant, the facilitator will deliver a specially-designed version of the stimulation curriculum to a group of mothers and children. The group will meet weekly and is planned to have a maximum of 9 mothers and children.,4.

"Interventions:  This study will evaluate two interventions, 1) subsidized daycare and 2) subsidized daycare plus quality improvements, using two treatment arms and one comparison group. ,Intervention 1: Subsidized Daycare,The costs of formal daycare can be prohibitively costly to mothers with low earning potential, such as women living in the informal settlement areas of Nairobi.  Subsidizing daycare could lower this barrier to economic engagement and encourage mothers with young children to enter the labor force or work longer hours, thereby increasing their household’s total income. Such support may be particularly beneficial to disadvantaged women such as single mothers and recent immigrants who are expected to have the least social support in helping with their childcare. Women in this arm of our study will receive a full year of vouchers for free daycare services at selected local facilities. Participating daycares will also receive modest monthly cash transfers to compensate them for the additional monitoring and help them accommodate a possible increase in their number of enrolled pupils. ,Intervention 2: Subsidized Daycare at Improve Daycare Facilities,Given the low quality of some daycare centers in the informal settlements, some mothers may be reluctant to place their children in daycares regardless of the costs. To test whether the availability of affordable and high-quality daycares increase women’s engagement with the workforce, we provide quality improvements to half of the daycares we are subsidizing. These quality improvements include the training of all childcare providers in each selected center using an adapted program used by the Aga Khan Foundation, which is based on UNICEF/WHO’s Care for Child Development (C4CD) model, an Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention. The C4CD intervention provides information and recommendations for cognitive stimulation and social support to young children, through sensitive and responsive caregiver-child interactions. The C4CD package guides health workers, caregivers, counsellors, and parents to build stronger relationships with their children, solve problems in caring for their children, and learn how to be sensitive and respond to the needs of the children. Childcare providers will also receive training on nutrition, child security, toy development, hygiene, sanitation, adequate sleep, and record keeping. The training will be covered in 5 full-days (after 2 days of a needs assessment pre-visit by the master trainers). Refresher training would also be offered half way through the intervention period. Two District Centres for Early Childhood Education (DICECE) officers will also be assigned to Korogocho area to check in and reinforce the learnings with caregivers through daycare visits, and act as the go between our project and the county government. Daycares in the quality arm will also receive material supplies in the form of mattresses, potties, padlocks (to increase security), and materials to build portable hand washing stations, toys, and teaching tools",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000844,"African Medical and Research Foundation, in Kenya (AMREF),Research Ethics Board, McGill University","2015-02-23,2015-01-29",,"September 15, 2015",,,,,,,,,"AMREF-ESRC159/2015, 214-1214"

"A. Current practice (control). The control arm will consist of the current Ministry of Health campaign. Printed campaign materials are distributed to households. Health promoters request permission to spray and schedule insecticide spray for the next day. Promoters can answer any questions or concerns. ,B. Advance commitment responsive scheduling. Households are approached 2-4 weeks prior to the spray date and asked to commit, in advance, to participate. Households that agree to participate are offered convenient 2-hour appointment windows on a future spray date. Planning prompts, which encourage households to make a specific plan to prepare the home for spraying, are also offered. Households can request a paper or text message reminder prior to their scheduled appointment, and will be able to reschedule their appointment if necessary. Households are then also visited before the previously scheduled appointment by the health promoter to confirm the appointment.,C.  Neighbor recruitment. One month prior to targeted spray dates, study staff approach formal community leaders (Ministry of Health-trained health promoters, block captains, and elected community officials) and informal neighborhood opinion leaders (corner store owners, day care coordinators), explain the campaign in depth, and ask leaders to serve as neighbor recruiters. Each recruiter is given promotional t-shirts, a clipboard, and the same educational materials used by campaign staff. Recruiters are asked to promote the campaign  to a pre-specified list of 10-12 nearby households, wear the campaign t-shirts regularly, and distribute additional Ministry of Health materials. ,D.  Contingent group sweepstakes. Contiguous households are assigned to sweepstakes groups of 5-7 households. Sweepstakes groups are randomly assigned a lottery number. Households whose lottery group is selected and who participated in spraying will win a hardware store voucher of 50 nuevo soles.

"In this experiment we will investigate the influence of two online-based entrepreneurship programmes and compare the effects of a programme with experiential design with a programme which is based on lectures by entrepreneurial role models. During this process we will be able to assess in which way the educational dimensions of “mastery experience” and “vicarious learning” influence the entrepreneurial self-efficacy of young pupils as well as their inclination to participate in high-growth oriented entrepreneurial activities.,3000 randomly selected pupils (year of birth = 2000) will be randomly divided into three groups and invited to participate in three different online-based educational programmes all of which will last for two weeks. In order to test the effectiveness of practice-based and experiential entrepreneurship education one group will be requested to perform weekly challenges and reflect on how they have been affected by the activities which they have performed and on the type of learning that they perceive to have gained from these challenges. This group will be compared to pupils who will be asked to view and reflect on two weekly presentations by entrepreneurial role models. Both of these groups will be compared to a control group of pupils who will only be requested to view and reflect on two short scientific documentaries each week.

"Once recruited and consented into the study, participants completed a brief electronic pre-survey with an enumerator to gather demographics and a baseline for their intention to register and vote in the forthcoming 2016 election. ,Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of eight conditions (the seven messages or a control, which received no message). Respondents received the message read out face-to-face by enumerators. All messages were delivered in English and the consent and survey process were conducted in English. Given that our sample is from urban Gauteng, levels of English proficiency are high.,These messages were crafted from theories of political participation. In addition, we conducted eight focus groups in May 2015 in the study area with both registered and unregistered voters aged 18-30. We discussed whether participants think voting is important, their reasons for (not) registering and voting, where they get information from, and who or what influences their decisions. Many of the phrases in the messages, such as politics being ‘an old person’s game’, every vote ‘being counted’, the youth ‘jobs crisis’, or non-voters ‘letting their community down’, were drawn from these focus groups. We also asked focus group participants to recommend adaptations to messages to make them more appealing to young people.,The different messages focused on one's obligation to vote (as a citizen, as a young person, or stemming from South Africa's history), on the idea that every vote counts, on the fact that young people are underrepresented in parliament, on the idea that voting may force politicians to pay more attention to issues which affect young people, and on the idea that one's community will know if one does not vote.

"We implemented our mobile-phone based savings program over Safaricom’s Sambaza airtime sharing service. Using Sambaza, Safaricom users can send airtime to each other free of charge. Subjects saved into our program by sending airtime to a designated project phone that held the airtime in an account for each user. We chose to run our savings program via airtime rather than M-Pesa to avoid the fees involved with conversion to and from M-Pesa.,Subjects received two SMS messages every morning after the first morning of the project period. The first message was an end-of-day message that reported how much the subject saved the previous day, how much the subject earned through interest or winnings, and their total balance. An hour later, subjects received a beginning-of-day message encouraging them to save that day. Subjects were allowed to send in savings at any time but any savings sent in after the end-of-day message would be counted towards the next day’s total. We used a custom-developed administrative system to manage the savings program. This system logged airtime sent to our project phone, maintained an internal ledger of balances, sent automated SMS confirmations after every transaction, and conducted the daily lottery game.,Subjects were enrolled in the savings program for a total of 60 days, split into consecutive 30-day periods. After the first 30 days, subjects were allowed to withdraw any amount of their savings up to the total balance. Outside of this opportunity, regular withdrawals were not allowed. If a subject wished to withdraw their balance, they were required to withdraw from the entire experiment.,At the end of our experiment, we returned subjects’ savings and accumulated interest or winnings via an M-Pesa transfer. This M-Pesa transfer included the extra withdrawal fees needed to cash out an amount equal to the subject’s full account balance. Therefore, subjects paid no explicit fees to participate in our program.,2.1 Treatment groups,Subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups and had the chance to earn either daily interest (in the form of matching) or play a daily lottery depending on assign- ment.,2.1.1 Interest (control group),Subjects in the control group participated in a standard, interest-bearing savings program. Subjects earned a 5% matching contribution on any amount that they saved in a particular day.,2.1.2 Lottery,After saving a non-zero amount, subjects earned a lottery ticket - transmitted via text message, which could win a cash prize in proportion to the amount they saved. A lottery ticket was a random sequence of four numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive. Each day, our administrative system randomly generated a winning sequence of four numbers. Prizes were awarded according to how well a subject’s lottery numbers matched the winning numbers. If the first or second numbers matched, a 10% match of savings was awarded. If both the first and second numbers matched, a 100% match of savings was awarded. Finally if all numbers matched, a prize of 200 times daily savings was awarded. The earnings on this,3,lottery ticket were equal in expectation to the 5% match earned in the control group.

"The intervention will be integrated as a component of the larger Proyecto Capital program in Colombia, which seeks the financial inclusion of millions of poor households by working through CCT programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Colombia, the Departamento para la Prosperidad Social (DPS) manages the Más Familias en Acción (MFA) program, which reaches 3 million poor and extremely poor individuals and their families. This includes households that rank lower than established thresholds on the national poverty index (SISBEN), families in extreme poverty (those belonging to the Red Unidos initiative), and victims of displacement caused by Colombia’s internal armed conflict. Given the program’s credibility and dedicated resources, opportunities exist for supplemental interventions that would enable transfer recipients to make better use of the funds. ,The intervention to be evaluated is based on the LISTA application and accompanying distribution methodology developed by Fundación Capital. The tablet application was developed for use without the help of a trainer or facilitator, providing an interactive experience. The application does not require Internet access to function and can thus reach low-income users even in the most rural areas. By integrating audio, video, and gaming elements, the didactic application overcomes literacy barriers, providing an entertaining educational experience, while empowering women through technology.,Users choose when to use the tablet, the order in which they access the training topics (modules), and the time they spend on each, revisiting if they choose topics that were unclear.  Audiovisual features also facilitate training for illiterate users. Interactive features and user-centric design enables identification with the application and stimulates participation.,There are games and exercises incorporated into all of the training elements along five educational modules:,(1) ABCs of Savings: provides educational content and information on topics such as savings and insurance, with testimonial videos and illustrative stories, all with the objective of increasing financial capabilities and helping users make informed financial decisions.,(2) Managing my Money: helps users organize their income and expenses and allows them to visualize their savings and debt, with the goal of preventing over-indebtedness. ,(3) My Bank: provides information about financial products in general, but also with specific information about the savings accounts and mobile wallets cash transfer recipients already have access to, in order to encourage their use. ,(4) Games: this module includes several ATM and mobile wallet simulators, users can gain confidence in using the real thing, and also includes games that they can play individually or in groups, which help them review important concepts and rules of thumb.,(5) Más Familias en Acción module: the objective is to clarify how the program works, how cash transfers are assigned, and the program benefits and obligations. This module was added because field studies highligted a lack of understanding of how the program works, with participants believing rumors that if they save in the bank account opened for them by the Government, they will be expelled from the program.,The application to be evaluated takes into account user feedback on content and design and thus has new educational topics, exercises and simulations (i.e., mobile wallets), based on identified needs of the MFA population and the specificities of the current CCT-linked financial products. The estimated time spent receiving the full training is an average of three hours per person. In sum, the tablet has the power to increase user and family interest in financial issues,  to give motivation to set up savings goals, maintain better control of household finances and to increase user confidence in the financial system.,The intervention will involve a ‘basic’ treatment – a 8-month implementation of the tablet application, which will reach between 100,000 to 110,000 participants. Part of these participants will continue with an ‘enhanced’ treatment, which involves receiving text messages for four months following the end of their tablet treatment. ,Messages will include mobile text ‘reinforcement’ messages offering knowledge reminders or rules of thumb, as well as saving ‘nudges’. These text messages will be sent for four months biweekly (2 per month) after completing the tablet usage.,Texts will be directly related to the content included in the application and to the specific financial product the government provided for that person as part of the CCT program. Some of them will also be nudge messages, with a call to action to put in practice what was learnt.,Tablets will be distributed among madres líderes (mother leaders) of the MFA program. During an introductory session, these leaders will commit to the program and set their goals in terms of number of women they will help train with the tablet app during their rotation period (35 on average). Each leader will have 2 months to reach their goal, after which they will rotate the tablet and pass it along to a different mother leader in the community, so that many people can be reached with a smaller amount of tablet computers.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000696,Human Subjects Committee for Innovations for Poverty Action IRB-USA,2015-04-20,,"September 10, 2015",,,,,,,,,3324

"In the interest of faithfully replicating Power to the People (P2P), the intervention was designed to match the P2P protocols as closely as possible, with modifications made as necessary to accommodate the factorial design we employ. Whereas P2P had just two treatment arms (full treatment and control), ours has four:  1) full replication of P2P (information dissemination to community and health center staff; mobilization of and development of action plans by community and health center staff; and holding of interface meetings between community members and health center staff); 2) information dissemination and mobilization only; 3) interface only; 4) control.,Prior to the start of the intervention, baseline data was collected in each of the 377 study health centers and in their catchment areas.  This information was summarized in a Citizen Report Card (designed to match that used in P2P), and was disseminated during the intervention in treatment arms 1 and 2. As in P2P, we partnered with local NGOs to disseminate this report card information to citizens and to work with them over several days to inform them of their rights and entitlements and to develop an action plan in light of this information.  As in P2P, the local NGOs also worked with clinic staff to present and explain the results of the report card and to develop an action plan.  In treatment arms 1 and 3 (full P2P replication and interface only), the local NGO also organized meetings between health facility staff and representatives of the local community to discuss how to proceed in light of the action plans developed by each party.,As in P2P, the main intervention was supplemented in each (non-control) treatment arm with half-day follow-up meetings every six months for community members and health workers to enable participants to track the implementation of the action plan, determine new areas of concern, and come up with a new set of recommendations for improvement of local health services. ,Midline data (using the same instruments employed at baseline, with some additional questions to better ascertain the quality of treatment take-up and to help understand the mechanisms at work in generating treatment effects) are collected 12 months after the baseline data.  Endline data is then collected again at 24 months.  Since P2P reported treatment effects at 12 months, the main replication of P2P involves a comparison of baseline and midline data.

"The Aflatoun curriculum includes lessons about planning, budgeting, saving, proper spending, as well as self-esteem building exercises. It uses songs, games, and worksheets, which put children at the center of the learning process. Aflatoun also adapts its messages and activities to the context of the countries in which it operates, focusing on cultural heritage and community in order to foster a collective sense of empowerment among participant children. The HMB intervention, in contrast, is solely focused on financial education and is designed to provide a comparison for Aflatoun’s unique social and attitudinal curriculum. IPA developed the HMB intervention as a group savings scheme with a financial literacy curriculum. Some of the topics covered in the curriculum include: What is Money?, Saving and Spending, Planning and Budgeting, and Entrepreneurship, as well as lessons in how to use the Money Box, a lockbox that stores group savings.  ,To implement the two programs, local partner organizations trained approximately 200 teachers (two teachers in each selected school). Teachers instructed two multi-grade clubs, with an average of 54 students per club, and delivered the assigned curriculum, in addition to providing a secure storage space for the money saved, generally in the teacher’s locked office. Clubs met, on average, once a week after school at a time decided by the members. Students saved money from their pocket change and recorded transactions on individual passbooks.

"Youth Advocate Programs and Children's Home + Aid will receive referrals from Chicago Public Schools, the Cook County Juvenile Probation Department, and other agency and community partners that work with youth who are involved in the juvenile justice system and have disengaged from school. Youth who are randomly selected from an eligible population and agree to participate in the intervention will be assigned an advocate who will interact weekly with the youth in one-on-one and in family meetings and recreational groups. Additionally, the youth will participate in group or individual therapy that uses SPARCS (Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress), an evidence-based and trauma-focused model. The program is designed specifically for youth who are actively gang-affiliated, on juvenile probation, have been found guilty of weapons offenses, are seriously disruptive in school through chronic truancy, serious misconduct or frequent suspensions, or have been direct victims of or witnesses to traumatic violence. The program will be delivered in two sessions, each lasting five months and enrolling 110 youth at a time, with the goal of reducing criminal and violent behavior and improving academic achievement by helping youth stabilize and successfully participate in school, community, and family life.

"We work with a leading bank in Bangladesh to offer a DPS commitment savings product to garment workers that already receive their monthly salary into an electronic payroll account. Workers are given detailed information about the product and have the opportunity to sign up for a DPS account. If they do so, they can choose an amount to be debited from their monthly salary and deposited into their savings account.,The intervention varies the conditions under which workers are offered the product. All workers in the treatment groups receive a detailed presentation of the product terms and characteristics and complete a short survey at the end of the information sessions. The main intervention consists of two additional features that are added to the product presentations for randomly chosen subgroups of workers: (1) an endorsement of the product from the employer, delivered by a floor manager (2) an announcement that feedback about the sign-up decision will be provided to the employer.,The intervention is set-up as a simple 2x2 design with the following treatment groups:,1. Control [No offer],2. T1: No employer endorsement + no feedback to employer [Basic offer],3. T2: No employer endorsement + feedback to employer,4. T3: Employer endorsement + no feedback to employer,5.

"Policy Issue: ,Executive function skills—which are related to memory, reasoning, and problem solving—are important for school readiness, early school achievement and lifelong learning. However, growing up in poverty can hinder the development of executive function: children from low-income backgrounds often have lower levels of cognitive skills and social-emotional maturity. These early gaps jeopardize children’s capacity to learn in primary school, leading to weak academic performance throughout their schooling with consequences for their well-being in adulthood. There is ongoing debate on whether focusing on active and participatory learning might improve early childhood development (ECD) curriculums. Thus, there is a need for more evidence on what types of ECD programs support the development of executive function, especially for low-income children. ,Context of the Evaluation:,Over the past 15 years, the provision of preschool for children ages 5-6 (called “Grade R”) has expanded massively in South Africa. While the government has not yet reached its target of universal provision, the vast majority (86 percent) of 5-year-olds were enrolled in some form of ECD education in 2014. However, these Grade R programs are typically taught by under-qualified teachers who often have a limited understanding of young children’s development and do not know how to facilitate learning through structured play. ,Care for Education, a non-profit organization, has developed an ECD program in collaboration with the LEGO Foundation. The program is called Six Bricks and involves a range of hands-on, playful games and activities designed to promote concentration, memory, problem solving, and other aspects of executive function. The LEGO Foundation is now exploring whether delivering the program through a low cost and scalable teacher training model is effective in improving children’s executive function.  This program is being implemented among Grade R students in under-privileged areas of KwaZulu-Natal.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000963,"Ethics in Research Committee, Faculty of Commerce, University of Cape Town",2015-02-07,,"December 01, 2015",,,,,,,,,na
"The project consists of two interventions implemented simultaneously. Using a factorial design, each intervention will be measured independently in addition to the interaction effect between interventions.,The first intervention consists of facility-level performance indicator reports (PIRs) sent to health facilities monthly via mobile phone. The reports use Ministry of Health (MoH) Health Management Information System (HMIS) data and compare performance over the past 3 months to performance at the same time 12 months before.   A PIR comprises 3 SMS reports.  The three different SMS reports sent each month are described below:,1. AVERAGE THREE MONTH REPORT: The average of each indicator for the previous three months. The indicators are first antenatal care visit, fourth antenatal care visit, deliveries and third doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered. In addition, the reporting rate for the past three months will be revealed. If a facility fails to report an indicator in a given month, the score for that indicator in that month is zero.,2. CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR: The average three month report from this year compared to the same period last year. For example, the August report from this year is composed of an average of May, June and July 2015, compared to May, June and July 2014. The total score represents overall change from last year and is an average of the individual changes observed among the four indicators.,3. RANK: A facility’s improvement compared to other facilities in their district. The biggest improvements from the previous year rank highest. HCIIs and HCIIIs are ranked separately, so facilities are told their rank out of the number of HCII or HCIII facilities in their district. The report also names the facility performing just above them and the facility performing just below. ,The second intervention is district-level PIRs sent to the District Health Office every month. One report is sent by SMS, and a second report by email.   The components of these message are as follows:,1. EMAIL: The district health office receives the same monthly reports as the facility. The three reports are aggregated into a single line per facility on a spreadsheet in an email that will be sent from the MoH. The email will contain the same data as the three reports shown above so that the District Health Office (DHO) can follow-up with the facilities that are under-performing and congratulate the leaders.,2.  SMS: At the same time, an SMS will be sent to DHO officials identifying the top-3 and bottom-3 performing HCII and HCIII facilities in a district as well as a reminder to the DHO to look at the full facility level reports, which have been sent by email.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000798,"Uganda National Council for Science  and Technology,New York University - University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects,Makerere University School of Public Health: Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee","2015-08-19,2015-01-06,2015-05-07",,"October 21, 2015",,,,,,,,,"HS 1875,15-10501,293"

"The Youth Employment and Skills Development Project (PEJEDEC : Projet Emploi Jeunes et Développement des Compétences) was launched in 2011, with World Bank support (US$50M). The issue of employment, and particularly the issue of youth employment, is one of the priorities of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire. The objective of this program is to facilitate access to employment opportunities for young people from 18 to 30 years of age.  In particular, one of the components of this project, the Labor-intensive Public Works Program (LIPW) (original name THIMO : Travaux à Haute Intensité de Main d'Oeuvre), provides temporary job opportunities for low-skilled youth. The Cote d’Ivoire Emergency Youth Employment and Skills Development creates temporary employment opportunities, while simultaneously introducing and testing a range of strategies to transition into more sustainable sources of productive employment and more productive household enterprises.The target group is youth, defined as 18-30 years of age. THIMO  was implemented in 16 localities throughout Cote d’Ivoire, attracting young people from urban and peri-urban areas mainly. The project promotes the participation of women by reserving a percentage of LIPW jobs (30%). 12,693 young people between 18 and 30 benefited from this program between 2012 and 2015.,As part of the labor-intensive public works program, beneficiaries were given temporary employment for six months at a daily minimum wage of 2,500 CFA francs. They are supervised by the National Roads Agency (Agence de Gestion des Routes - AGEROUTE) and perform road maintenance work: earth removal, ditch cleaning, maintenance of green spaces, etc. All participants are paid through bank accounts opened by the project. All participants also take part in sensitization sessions on HIV-AIDS, citizenship and hygiene (around 40h). Through the public works program, youth earn on average 55,000 CFA francs a month for six months, establish a work routine, receive some basic life skills training, and strengthen their social networks by working with groups of peers. This first phase seeks to help youths to stabilize themselves personally, socially and financially, all of which can help overcome constraints to enter self-employment or access wage jobs in the medium-term.,The project also introduces a range of graduation mechanisms to that aim to help them create household enterprises, or to transition into wage employment after graduating from the public works. Youths are paid into a bank account so that they can start savings with the objective to set-up a business after the end of the program. In addition, a randomly selected sub-set of beneficiaries received a basic entrepreneurship training and follow-up support to help them set-up household enterprise. Another randomly selected sub-set of beneficiaries received training that provides sensitization on wage employment opportunities and information on how to search and apply for wage jobs.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000763,J-PAL Europe,2014-07-30,,"October 09, 2015",,,,,,,,,CE/2014 - 003

Neonate will be weighed using a standard baby weighing scale available in the labour ward. Gestational age will be determined by the use of a Ballard examination within 24 hours of delivery.,Laboratory procedures,The blood films obtained will be stained using Giemsa stains. Thick film will be examined by assessing both parasites and leucocytes on the same field until 500 leucocytes will be counted. Parasite densities will be determined by the use of an assumed leucocyte count of 8000/µl. Thin films will be used to determine the parasite species if thick films yield positive results. The prepared films will be read two assigned laboratory Scientists and a discordant result will have a third reading by another laboratory Scientists. The haemoglobin level will be determined by using Hemotocrit centrifuge.,Follow up and further treatment  ,All participants will be followed up accordingly in the antenatal clinic at least a minimum of four visits.

"Project READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During Summer) is a voluntary scaffolded summer reading program with two primary components.  In the spring, just prior to the end of the school year, students in the program are taught six lessons (each lasting approximately one hour) during the school day. These lessons are focused around reading strategies that are designed to help beginning readers to read outside of school, with limited or no adult supports. Parents are also invited with their children to attend an afterschool family literacy event focused on the READS comprehension activities.  Then during the summer, each student is mailed 10 books, one per week. Students are tested for reading comprehension in the spring and fall. The spring test serves as a baseline measure of reading skills, and the fall test serves as a post-test. ,The books are chosen to match each student’s reading skill level and reading interests as best as possible. Reading skill levels are measured using the spring baseline reading comprehension test, which are translated into Lexiles, a proprietary system designed to align reading skills with the difficulty of children’s books. Students are also asked questions about the types of books they would like to read. Using an algorithm, books are then chosen that best match each student’s interest among those that are the appropriate difficulty given the student’s baseline reading skill level.,We implemented Project READS for 2nd and 3rd graders in 463 classrooms in 59 public schools in 7 North Carolina school districts in the spring and summer of 2013. Students randomly selected to be in the treatment group were given six reading comprehension lessons in the spring that focused on reading activities designed to foster children’s engagement with books at home during the summer.  Parents were also invited to an afterschool family literacy event where they learned about the READS activities.  Treatment group students were then mailed 10 books, one per week, during the summer. The books were matched to students based on their baseline reading skill level and their interests. Students were encouraged to read the books, and were asked to mail a tri-fold after they read each book; the tri-fold included three comprehension questions about each book and a few questions designed to prompt the students to use the reading strategies taught during the spring lessons.

"The project took advantage of a program launched in Kenya by Texas A&M AgriLife Research in 2014 to build the aflatoxin testing capacity of maize industry and regulatory bodies.  The program, Aflatoxin Proficiency Testing and Control for Africa (APTECA), is patterned after a successful aflatoxin co-regulation program in Texas.   In order to use the APTECA logo on packaging or marketing materials, millers are required to: pass an aflatoxin analysis proficiency test, conduct weekly analysis of laboratory control samples to ensure testing accuracy, and develop and adhere to a rigorous aflatoxin food safety plan. Weekly audits of test records and related processes help ensure adherence to protocols.   Companies repeatedly testing above the regulatory limit for aflatoxin must undertake corrective action and face a temporary suspension of APTECA logo use. ,The project partnered with the first commercial maize miller in Kenya to join the APTECA program and incorporate the “Alfatoxin tested verified by APTECA” label in its packaging and marketing materials.   Because this is a potentially high-risk investment for a miller, costs of compliance with APTECA requirements beyond the firms’ current procedures during the study period were covered through research funds, and APTECA membership was provided free of charge through Texas AgriLife Research.  ,Six months prior to the launch of the labeled product, the miller provided lists of shops and distributors carrying their brand in 6 counties. Shops meeting the following criteria were considered for the study:  shops could not be within easy walking distance of another shop in study, shops sold at least 48 kg of the study brand per week and shops had to be willing and able to track sales and prices of all maize flour in their shops. Fifteen shops in each county were initially recruited into the study.  ,After eligibility screening, shop owners were invited to participate in the study. They were told that if they chose to participate, they would be asked to track maize flour sales daily and provide this information to the study staff weekly; in compensation they would receive a monthly payment of 2000 Kenyan shillings (approximately $22 US at the time). A shop survey was then administered to the shop owner, which covered the volume of sales of the participating miller’s products as well as maize flour more generally, and basic characteristics of the shop.,Sales and prices of all maize flour brands were recorded by participating shop owners in a ledger provided to them. Field officers collected sales tracking ledgers weekly, and reviewed entries with the owners before entering the data electronically.  In this way, shop owners were trained and retrained on how to correctly complete the sales sheets well in advance of the intervention.  The price of whole grain maize at a vendor near each participating shop was also recorded by study staff during data collection visits  Over the first two months of sales tracking, several shops were dropped from the sample based on failure to consistently complete sales records. Of the remaining 78 shops, five shops with much higher total maize flour sales than the rest were dropped from the sample.,In June 2015 the miller’s existing brand began appearing in shops with the logo.  Shops were assigned to the following treatment groups based on random assignment after stratifying by county and average weekly sales of the miller’s product:,1. Control (24 shops),2. Initial marketing only (12 shops),3. Multiple marketing rounds, no discount (12 shops),4. Initial discount + marketing (12 shops),5. Multiple discount rounds + marketing (13 shops),Once the mill began using the packages with the logo, all shops stocked the new packages, but in the control shops nothing was done to draw attention to the product change.  While it is not likely that consumers will notice the addition of the small logo on the packet or understand its significance, follow-up interviews will determine what consumers knew or noticed about the aflatoxin logo.,Marketing treatments consisted of week-long leafletting campaigns at the shop and nearby open-air market where whole-grain maize is sold in addition to hanging posters at the shop for the duration of the study.  The initial marketing groups received one week of marketing, while in multiple marketing treatments, the leafletting was repeated three times in four weeks intervals.  The discount treatment reduced the price during the first week of marketing to induce consumers of cheaper brands or whole grain maize to switch.  In the multiple discount treatment the discount was repeated during the second marketing campaign. The discount was a flat discount of 5 Kenyan shillings per kg, roughly a 10 percent discount. Field officers were trained to explain the leaflet content in local languages. Sales of all brands were tracked for 6 months.  A baseline study of over 2000 consumers in these markets conducted in March 2015 allows us to characterize maize consumption and purchase behavior as well as socio-demographic characteristics of potential buyers and follow up with these consumers after the randomized controlled trial.

"Project READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During Summer) is a voluntary scaffolded summer reading program with two primary components.  In the spring, just prior to the end of the school year, students in the program are taught six lessons (each lasting approximately one hour) during the school day. These lessons are focused around reading strategies that are designed to help beginning readers to read outside of school, with limited or no adult supports. Parents are also invited with their children to attend an afterschool family literacy event focused on the READS comprehension activities.  Then during the summer, each student is mailed 10 books, one per week. Students are tested for reading comprehension in the spring and fall. The spring test serves as a baseline measure of reading skills, and the fall test serves as a post-test. ,The books are chosen to match each student’s reading skill level and reading interests as best as possible. Reading skill levels are measured using the spring baseline reading comprehension test, which are translated into Lexiles, a proprietary system designed to align reading skills with the difficulty of children’s books. Students are also asked questions about the types of books they would like to read. Using an algorithm, books are then chosen that best match each student’s interest among those that are the appropriate difficulty given the student’s baseline reading skill level.,We implemented Project READS for 2nd and 3rd graders in 463 classrooms in 59 public schools in 7 North Carolina school districts in the spring and summer of 2013. Students randomly selected to be in the treatment group were given six reading comprehension lessons in the spring that focused on reading activities designed to foster children’s engagement with books at home during the summer.  Parents were also invited to an afterschool family literacy event where they learned about the READS activities.  Treatment group students were then mailed 10 books, one per week, during the summer. The books were matched to students based on their baseline reading skill level and their interests. Students were encouraged to read the books, and were asked to mail a tri-fold after they read each book; the tri-fold included three comprehension questions about each book and a few questions designed to prompt the students to use the reading strategies taught during the spring lessons. Students assigned to the control group received no books during the summer, and participated in six mathematics lessons during the spring while the treatment students participated in the reading lessons.",,No,No,59 schools (randomization was conducted at the student level within classrooms) ,No,"Guryan, J., Kim, J.S., & Quinn, D.M.

Correlational evidence suggests that reading skills are strongly related to the amount of reading,students do outside of school. Experimental evidence testing whether this relationship is causal is lacking.,We report the results from a randomized evaluation of a summer reading program called Project READS,,which induces students to read more during the summer by mailing ten books to them, one per week.,Simple intent-to-treat estimates show that the program increased reading during the summer, and show,significant effects on reading comprehension test scores in the fall for third grade girls but not for third,grade boys or second graders of either gender. Analyses that take advantage of within-classroom random,assignment and cross-classroom variation in treatment effects show evidence that reading more books,generates increases in reading comprehension skills, particularly when students read carefully enough,to be able to answer basic questions about the books they read, and particularly for girls.","MOD-20091-06,F20091-106"
"We will partner with Ayesha Abed Foundation, which is associated with BRAC Social Enterprise Division, to implement this project. The Foundation was established in 1983 and employs independent female workers (“artisans”) through its 600 sub-centres located in different parts of the country. Each sub-centre employs about 20-25 artisans who work mostly independently. At the sub-centres, the artisans almost always carry out simple tasks such as stitching (allowing the comparability of productivity between artisans across sub-centres). ,The Foundation will roll out a mandatory health insurance policy (called Health Security Scheme) to all its (about 500) sub-centres to cover all the artisans associated with the Foundation with a nominal contribution of BDT 25 from the eligible artisans (working for at least four months over the past six months at the time of the enrolment). The Foundation is in the process of revising the policy and coverage under the health security scheme.,The Foundation will establish a referral system (in partnership with the BRAC’s Health Program). Once the condition is approved, the beneficiary will receive a pre-committed fund to pay for the possible in-patient services purchased from a pre-approved hospital. Atypical of other schemes, there will not be reimbursement and the beneficiary is allowed to keep any surplus of the fund disbursed. The benefit package will cover the husband of the artisan and up to two children. In case the artisan is unmarried, two other adult family members (e.g. parents) will be allowed to be under the program.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000919,"James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University",2015-10-26,,"December 06, 2015",,,,,,,,,67
",Participants were randomised into two groups: comparison and treatment.The treatment was the offer of a commitment contract that they were invited to personalise by writing in their names, signature, and date. The contract was designed to have a certain degree of visual gravitas and formality, on card of A5 size that could be carried around in a handbag or satchel, or stuck on a fridge or wall. They were advised to keep it somewhere they would see it on most days, and to discuss it with friends and family if they wished but not with the other group members.  Comparison group members completed a baseline survey and returned to the weight loss group, and asked to continue with the programme as normal.

"Vote-buying is a widespread practice in developing countries that may undermine the accountability and responsiveness of elected officials, especially to the needs of the poor. Vote-buying may derive its effectiveness in influencing voter behavior by appealing to internalized norms of reciprocity, conveying information about candidates or because of lack of faith in the secret ballot. One way to reduce the incidence of vote-buying is by diminishing its effectiveness in influencing electoral outcomes. We designed and deployed a radio campaign during the April-May 2014 general election period in India.

"Eligible poor, rural Malagasy households will be given a cash transfer by the Government of Madagascar in a program called the Human Development Cash Transfer (HDCT). The HDCT will last for three years, with cash transfers of approximately 10-12 USD being issued to beneficiary households once every two months. Receipt of the cash transfer will be conditioned on 80% school attendance for households with children ages 6-10 and will be unconditional for  households with children ages 0-5. A portion of the transfer beneficiaries will be organized into “Mother Leader” groups, or a group of approximately 10-15 women from the same community who are led by a community-elected female leader called a “Mother Leader” (ML). The MLs, who are beneficiaries themselves, will be trained to learn about and implement best practices in health, nutrition, and parenting. The MLs will guide their groups through modules on these various subjects as part of the cash transfer program. In addition, a portion of the Cash + ML recipients will also be exposed to behaviorally informed “nudges”, or organized activities that encourage beneficiaries to follow through on their intentions and actively work on their goals toward better household outcomes in health, productive activities, and well-being.,This trial will seek to evaluate the impact of the HDCT on household economic well-being, child health and educational outcomes, and anthropometrics measures.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000957,Chesapeake IRB,2015-11-05,,"November 20, 2015",,,,,,,,,Pro00013516
"External support is needed to enable venture teams to develop their business activities efficiently. The coaching intervention will focus on tactical knowledge, which is designed to help founders building appropriate networks and enhance their know-how where needed capabilities cannot be derived from books. Our delivery partner bwcon has had an efficient business coaching concept in place since 2005 which serves as support intervention in the planned RCT. Content-wise, the coaching sessions do not only provide business and technological expertise to new business founders, but particularly aim at accelerating the creation of networks and tactical implementation of venture development activities during the growth phase. Business as usual refers to venture teams with different levels and exposure to explicit business knowledge gained for instance through prior work experience or by non-tactical coaching input.",,,,,No,,,AEARCTR-0000973,,,,"December 08, 2015",,,,,,,,,
"The UCT Program implemented by GiveDirectly Inc. (GD) targets impoverished households in Kenya. The study evaluates GD’s intervention in the Rarieda District, in Western Kenya. GD’s intended beneficiaries are especially disadvantaged households, with per capita incomes below $1 per day. Households are identified as eligible using objective and transparent criteria that are highly correlated with poverty: dwellings lacking solid walls, floors, or roofs.,GD’s goal is to provide flexible financial assistance to those in greatest need, while maximizing cost efficiency by transferring cash electronically using M-Pesa mobile money technology, a key innovative feature of the program. M-Pesa is a mobile money system offered by Safaricom, the largest Kenyan mobile phone operator. GD transfers the money from GD’s M-Pesa account to that of the recipient. To facilitate the transfers, GD distributes a SIM card and asks the recipient to sign up for M-Pesa; then, money is transferred to the SIM card, and the recipient can withdraw the balance at an M-Pesa agent by putting the SIM card into the agent's cell phone, or using their own phone. ,This delivery method drastically cuts the costs of reaching the recipient: GD transfers 90% of the program’s total budget directly to a poor household, with the remainder covering recipient identification, including staff costs (7%), and mobile transfer fees for both GD and recipients (3%). Not only is the intervention cheap; the insights from the study can also be applied broadly, as the program can be implemented in any area with access to mobile money technology. As such technology spreads throughout the developing world, the program will become increasingly scalable.",,,,,Yes,,,AEARCTR-0000019,"Innovations for Poverty Action Kenya (IPAK) Institutional Review Board,Ethics Committee, Canton of Zurich,Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Ethics Review Committee (ERC),University of Zurich, Department of Economics Institutional Review Board,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Institutional Review Board","2011-04-30,2011-01-11,2011-04-19,2011-04-21,2011-10-20",,"June 28, 2013",,,,,,,,,"none,KEK-ZH-Nr. 2010-0477/0,NON-SSC NO. 171,none,1109004672"
