These private providers often have little to no certifiable medical training. Recent studies, using medical vignettes (or hypothetical medical situations) to measure clinical competence and direct observations of doctor-patient interactions to measure clinical practice, highlight the deplorably low standards in rural healthcare.  To address such standards, the Liver Foundation in Kolkata, West Bengal over the last two years has been working with private rural health care providers through capacity building activities to improve quality in the private sector. The program consists of multiple-week training to private rural health care providers on the basis of a well-developed curriculum in the district of Birbhum, West Bengal.

This study aims to assess the impact of this training program using a randomized evaluation.  We employ medical vignettes, provider diaries, direct observation, and standardized patients to assess how such a training program can effect clinical competence, practice, caseload and case types, and fee structures in the short run.

What are the Barriers to Industrial Upgrading? Evidence from Pakistan,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/817,"August 21, 2015",2015-08-21 10:16:21 -0400,AEARCTR-0000817,"Amit Khandelwal, ak2796@columbia.edu",on_going,2015-08-12,2017-12-31,"[""welfare"", """"]","F1,O1","A growing body of research suggests that innovation and quality improvements by manufacturing firms--which together we refer to as ""industrial upgrading""--are key elements in the process of private enterprise development in low-income countries. It is widely recognized that industrial upgrading is not automatic: some sectors in some countries successfully move up the ladder to more technologically sophisticated, higher value-added products, and others fail to do so. 

To investigate the role of the high cost of high-quality inputs in constraining upgrading, we propose an experiment with soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We will provide subsidies for an input, an artificial leather known as rexine, that is an important determinant of the quality of a soccer ball. The subsidies are offered to a random set of firms, and we will compare outcomes at the end of the experiment between treatment and control. 
",2015-08-12,2016-08-16,"The study investigates the extent to which high costs of high-quality inputs are a barrier to upgrading in the football sector. One of the primary inputs into football production is an artificial leather called rexine. We propose an experiment that offers subsidies for high-quality rexine to a random subset of firms and examine if this subsidy spurs industrial upgrading. 

We will look at two related but distinct dimensions of behavioral responses by firms. First, since high-quality inputs are likely to be complements in production, the subsidy may induce firms to purchase complementary high-quality inputs and produce higher quality footballs, using their existing technologies and production processes. Second, the subsidy may potentially stimulate learning and spur technological improvements in the production process, if for instance innovation has a higher return in high-quality segments of the industry or if producing higher-quality balls leads firms to transact with more sophisticated buyers. 

To capture these dimensions, we will track changes in other inputs (e.g., the quality of the bladder or latex glue), shifts in the composition of output toward higher-quality footballs and output prices, the composition of the buyers (e.g., the country of origin of the buyers) and other process innovations (e.g., adopting a cost-saving innovation developed by Atkin et al (2015) to reduce wastage of the high-quality rexine?). We also intend to examine whether such changes spill over to other firms that are linked to the treated firms through business, family, geographical or other networks.

We expect substantial heterogeneity in the size of the treatment effects along two dimensions. As described in the experimental design, all treatment firms are provided with exactly the same treatment (see experimental design---PKR 650,000 of vouchers for the purchase of any high-quality foreign rexine 1.5mm or thicker). For firms that produce many balls, the subsidy is small compared to their total rexine purchases and so will likely have little effect on their product mix. Similarly, for firms that already primarily produce with high-quality imported rexine, subsidizing these particular rexine types will also have little effect on their product mix. Accordingly, we intend to interact treatment with the following metrics measured over the 6 months preceding the experiment (measured at the baseline survey): a) the ratio of the subsidy to the total value of rexine purchases; b) the proportion of high-quality foreign rexine 1.5mm or thicker in total rexine purchases by quantity; and c) the proportion of balls produced by the firm that are high quality. Since these measures may be noisy, we also intend to interact with firm size, which is a well-measured proxy that captures these dimensions as large firms tend to both buy more rexine and produce higher quality balls.
","","In a previous study, Atkin et al 2015, we have explored technology adoption by soccer-ball firms in Sialkot, Pakistan. Through several rounds of data collections from that study, we have collected characteristics of firms (e.g., employees, types of balls, prices, profit rates, among other characteristics). We have also collected information about their input usage, and in particular the types of rexine they use for production. This protocol describes a new experiment that subsidizes the purchase of higher-quality rexine for a random subset of firms in our sample. Firms report using domestic rexine that is purchased from Sialkot or the Lahore, or imported rexine from either China, Korea or Japan. Japanese and Korean rexine are considered the highest quality, followed by Chinese rexine and then domestic rexine. Our sample consists of 67 manufacturers in Sialkot. (We have one pilot firm.) These are the active firms that either received the technology we invented for the previous study, or active firms that responded to at least two surveys in the previous study, produce on average less than 75k balls/month, and have fewer than 100 employees.
 
In August 2015, we conducted a public lottery where all firms were invited to attend, and food was provided. At the lottery, 30 of the 67 firms were selected at random through the drawing of lots. The firms selected in the lottery, the treatment firms, received PKR 650,000 of vouchers for the purchase of any high-quality foreign Rexine (1.5mm or thicker only). Given the nature of a public lottery, it was not possible to stratify the randomization in any way without raising suspicions by firms that the lottery was rigged.

In order to ensure that the subsidized rexine has been used by the firms, rather than resold on a secondary market, we will provide the subsidy in multiple stages in the form of vouchers. 

The winning firms were visited after the lottery and provided with a first voucher for PKR 200,000 of eligible Rexine. There will be three further vouchers. These additional vouchers will work slightly differently. These vouchers will reimburse firms for purchases they make. 
o	Voucher 2: If you purchase PKR 200,000 or Rexine, we pay PKR 175,000 of that.
o	Voucher 3: If you purchase PKR 200,000 or Rexine, we pay PKR 150,000 of that.
o	Voucher 4: If you purchase PRK 200,000 or Rexine, we pay PKR 125,000 of that.

The payment given for each voucher will not exceed its maximum value.  For example, if a firm would like to use the Voucher 2 to purchase PKR 225,000 worth of rexine, we will pay PKR 175,000 of that order.  If the firm does not wish to buy the entire voucher amount in one go, it can be used for a smaller amount where the subsidy is pro rata. For example, for voucher 3 a firm can spend only PKR 100,000 and then we will pay PKR 75,000 of that. Once a voucher is used, it cannot be used again even if less than PKR 200,000 was purchased with it. The vouchers have an expiration date of 1 year.

A firm that decides to use the vouchers will go to their supplier of choice to obtain the rexine. Once the footballs are manufactured, we will send trained auditors to ensure that the rexine variety purchased using the first voucher has been used. Upon successful audit, the firm can redeem the next voucher. 

At the end of the intervention, we plan to compare treatment and control firms along the outcomes discussed in Outcomes (End Points), allowing the size of the treatment effect to differ by the size of the subsidy relative to rexine purchases, the initial proportion of a firm’s production that uses high-quality imported rexine, the proportion of total output that is high-quality balls, and the size of the firm.

Increasing parental involvement has been widely touted as a means of overcoming the difficulties of low attendance, and poor quality learning which plagues many classrooms. However, it is still not clear whether parental involvement programs are a direct cause of children’s success, or whether these programs simply selectively attract parents who are already motivated to be engaged in their children’s success.

We provide  to half the parents (randomly choosen) the questions and answers of the pupil assessement and ask them to prepare their child to the test.   This second randomization is expected to generated a higher level of involvement on parents that received the treatment. ,"1°) Before Randomization
Before randomization and in each schools included in the experimental population, we identified a list of G4 or G5 teachers willing to facilitate the three meetings and be trained by the NGO. We also identified a list of parents, whose child is enrolled in  a G4 or a G5 classes. 

This design allows identifying 4 pairs of comparable groups: 
(1) the learners whose teacher is a facilitator and his parent is voluntary to attend the meeting 
(2) the learners whose teacher is not a facilitator but his parent is voluntary to attend the meeting 
(3) the learners whose teacher is a facilitator but parents did not volunteer for the meeting
(4) the learners whose teacher is not a facilitator but parents did not volunteer for the meeting

2°) After Randomization
Randomization at school level creates for each of these sub-group in the treatment group a relevant counterfactual in the control group. 
Hence, by comparing group 1 in treatment and control we get the direct effect of the program on the learners whose teacher is a facilitator and parent is voluntary to attend the meeting etc... We can also pool group 1 and 2 and estimate on them the effect of the program on the volunteer parents (direct treatment effect) while pooling 3 and 4 would allow estimation of the program's impact on the non volunteer parents (spill over of the program). 

3°) Randomizing information
In addition to randomizing schools, for the learners whose parents were volunteer, we have also randomized the information provided to parents about the achievement test organized at the end of the school year. Half of the volunteer parents were informed about the achievement test content and were advised to help their child preparing for it.  We believe that this second round of randomization at the individual level should provides sufficient variation to estimate the ""realized"" parental involvement (as opposed to the self-declared parental involvement that can be assessed from questionnaires).","",Randomization done in office by a computer,Schools,83 Schools,"14,000 Students; 14,000 Parents","41 Treatment Schools (Receive Parental Workshops)

The State of Government of Karnataka (GoK), India, proposes to tackle this issue through the use of technology via a pilot project in five districts of the state.

The smallest landholders are especially vulnerable to these shocks, because they cultivate marginal land and are unable to adopt technologies that buffer their productivity against these shocks.  In recognition that promoting sustainable irrigation and drainage is essential in making smallholder farmers resilient to these intensifying climate variations, the government of Mozambique has made the development of irrigation a priority for agriculture growth and rural development.

For both evaluations the main outcome indicator is yield. Our sampling frame will be based on the random selection of 25 households per scheme. To calculate the MDE of household Maize revenue per hectare (MZN/ha), we take the mean (1051), standard deviations (1186) and ICC (0.10) of yields from the Smallholders Survey collected in an adjacent region of Mozambique (Kondylis, Mueller, and Zhu, 2015). With a baseline and one follow up for yield outcomes, we should be able to detect a 18.7% increase in revenue the financial literacy intervention (64 clusters) and 23.8% in the water monitoring intervention (42 clusters). For the financial literacy intervention, the main outcome indicator of interest is proportion of farmers that meet their saving target after one year. We will have farmer level data on savings contributions for each of the on average 40 members of the farmers groups. We assume currently none of the farmers contribute to a common savings pool. The MDE ranges from 0.08 with an ICC of 0.05 to 0.13 with an ICC of 0.15. "

One common explanation is that the poor face temptations to misspend their income which they are unable to overcome given limited financial markets, and that aggregating steady streams of small amounts of income into larger lump sums would help mitigate these problems. This assumption has helped drive the research on commitment savings accounts (Ashraf and Karlan 2006, Brune et al. 2013). However, converting smooth income streams into larger, deferred sums may also lead to increased temptation and potentially poor choices - the proverbial effect of ""money burning a hole in one's pocket"". Banerjee et al. (2010) find evidence of this behavior among some users of microfinance in Hyderabad, and increasing temptation is consistent with anecdotal reports of behavior around payday in Malawi as well as research from the developed world (e.g. Stephens 2003). It is not currently understood what factors lead certain lump sums to be beneficial to achieving savings goals, while others lead people to give in to temptation, but the specific timing of the lump sum may play a role. This project uses an RCT to explore how the timing of wage payments changes the relative benefits of lump sums vs. small installments. 

We partner with a local NGO to expand a public works program by 350 workers who are employed for 16 days over the course of three months (Oct through Dec 2013), subdivided into two rounds. Workers are cross-randomized into two sets of experimental conditions, separately for each round of the study. The first study arm varies whether workers receive their pay in a single, lump-sum payment or in weekly installments. The second study arm varies how tempting the environment is in which workers receive their payments: All workers receive their pay at the same location, which is the site of the major local market, but some receive their pay on the weekly ""market day"", while others receive it the day before. To ensure that all workers face equal transaction costs, everyone will come to the market for brief surveys on both days, irrespective of whether they are being paid. The main outcomes of interest are survey measures of saving level, expenditure composition, loans, and transfers, as well as uptake of a high-interest, zero-risk ""bond"" offered to all the workers in the study that provides an objective measure of savings behavior.",2013-10-28,2014-01-24,"Our key outcome variables are:
1. Savings, expenditure, loans and transfers as measured via household surveys
2. Spending behavior captured through high-frequency surveys conducted while respondents are picking up their wage payments
3. Uptake of a high-interest ""bond"" offered to all respondents, that must be bought in large installments, as an objective measure of savings behavior","","The experiment was organized into two rounds that occurred over a period of three months from November 2013 to January 2014, with subjects randomized into treatment conditions separately by round. During each round, subjects worked for two weeks and then received their pay either a) in weekly installments beginning at the end of the second week of work; or b) in a single lump sum, about three weeks after the last day of work.

In addition to variation in payment frequency, workers received their pay either c) on Fridays or d) on Saturdays. The two variations on the timing of pay -- weekly vs. monthly and Friday vs. Saturday -- were cross-randomized, creating four study arms in each round. The payments were made at the site of a major local market that occurs on Saturdays, with the intention of inducing variation in people's temptation to overspend. During the week after the last payday in each round, all workers were visited for a detailed survey about their expenditure and income.

The variation in the day of the week of the payment was designed to shed light on the mechanisms behind the savings constraints people face. If money is received in a tempting environment, like the local market day, then arguably costs to resisting that temptation increase and workers would decide to spend and consume more right at the market when receiving their pay.

We picked Saturdays at the local trading center -- so that payroll for this group happened during the major market in the local area -- as a tempting context for the receipt of income. This choice was based on extensive qualitative and descriptive work with people in the local area. Anecdotally, people in Mulanje District often describe market days as tempting situations, in which excitement can cause them to purchase things they would rather not.

Presuming that attention is a scarce resource and important for the pursuit of saving plans, limits to attention in inter-temporal consumption and saving decisions may cause savers not to reach their savings goals. In turn, constant feedback on the savings performance may help to reach savings goals in the presence of limited attention. In this project we draw on a simple experiment to test whether the visual representation of savings balances stimulates savings behavior and helps individuals reach their savings goals. Doing so, we randomly offer transparent and non-transparent moneyboxes as a complementary savings device to current and former clients of a microfinance organization in Ethiopia. We hypothesize that the visual representation of saving balances via transparent money boxes increases savings and helps microfinance clients reach their savings goals. While this is our working hypothesis, we may also observe the opposite, i.e. that the visual representation of saving balances via transparent money boxes decreases savings (e.g. because of a higher temptation to spend money that can be seen, or because it is less likely to hide savings from others).",2014-12-15,2015-06-15,"Monetary savings, Savings goal attainment

","Our study covers households from 94 village clusters in remote areas in northern Ethiopia. This basically creates a census of the zone in which the RCT is conducted. Zone is third highest level of administration of the country, subordinate to region and national level. In each cluster 10 households were randomly sampled from client lists held at the branches of the local microfinance institution. The client list comprises current and former clients from the local microfinance institution.
 
Treatments are randomly assigned based on balanced baseline covariates with respect to the Mahalanobis distances. The 940 households were randomly assigned to either control or to one of twenty different treatment arms, such that 300 observations were assigned to control and 32 observations to each treatment arm. Thereafter the Mahalanobis distance with respect to the baseline covariates given below was calculated. Mahalanobis distance was calculated pairwise between any two treatment arms and also for each treatment arm relative to control. The random assignment was only accepted if the maximum distance to control was smaller than 0.605 and the maximum distance between any of the treatment arms was smaller than 1.322. These numbers corresponded to the 0.01 percentile of the empirical distribution of these distances.

Furthermore, it shows how the impact of more involved parents on their children is amplified at the class level by peer group interaction. We build on a large-scale controlled experiment run in a French deprived educational district, where parents of middle-school children were invited to participate in a simple program of parent–school meetings on how to get better involved in their children's education. At the end of the school year, we find that treated families have increased their school-and home-based involvement activities. In turn, pupils of treatment classes have developed more positive behaviour and attitudes in school, notably in terms of truancy and disciplinary sanctions (with effects-size around 15% of a standard deviation).

In Dance Movement Therapy, the movement of an individual reflects how he/ she thinks and feels, becomes the gateway into the person’s mental state of being (Helene, 2006). Literature suggests that movement exercises increase dopamine in the brain in children with ADHD ( Gronlund et al, 2005 ; Dulicai 1999). Studies explored the qualitative and stylistic features of movement that might distinguish hyperactive children from normally developing children. It was found that the hyperactive children showed a greater incidence of strength and intensity, and unexpected transitions (Goodman, 1999) . Previous studies have concluded that dance movement therapy, not only attempted in increasing attention, reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity but also reduced sense of disturbed body image, promote safe emotional expression and clearer positive sense of self, including better perception of external body boundaries as well as internal boundaries (Van Wagnen, 1999; Rachmany 2000; Cavanagh et al, 2001,  Gronlund et al, 2005).This research aims to explore the efficacy of dance moment therapy in reducing the symptoms of ADHD in children

The paper, once complete, will report estimates of the causal impact of wealth on health and childhood development. These estimates will be obtained by exploiting the randomized assignment of about a billion dollars in lottery prize money to a large sample of Swedes who have been matched to population-wide registers.

Upon completion of stage one, we decided to augment the original paper with estimates of the intergenerational effect of wealth on child health and child development. Because there may be little overlap between the health problems that commonly afflict children and those afflicting adults, we felt that it may not be appropriate to look at the same health outcomes that were examined in stage one. The literature on child development also emphasizes the adverse impacts that early child health can have on subsequent human capital accumulation; we therefore decided to include some measures of scholastic, cognitive and non-cognitive achievement. 

To avoid concerns about data-mining and specification searching, we decided to pre-specify our intergenerational analyses in this publicly available analysis plan before generating any matched datasets with child outcomes and parental lottery wealth.

While working in the manufacturing sector is hazardous per se due to the use of heavy machinery, tools, chemicals and the like, workers are even more at risk in an environment where basic labor standards are not enforced. Resulting work place accidents leading to the temporal or permanent inability to work, or even death, have severe economic consequences. Workers face unexpected health expenditures and the sudden loss of income. For enterprises, the sudden loss of workers interrupts productive activities and may affect profitability if enterprises cannot compensate the shortfall in labor in the production process.
   
The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) program of the ILO aims to improve occupational safety and health of SME workers in East Java. More specifically, the innovation implements kick-off trainings and several after-trainings to foster behavioral change with respect to workplace conditions among SMEs. After-trainings attempt to reinforce the occupational safety and health training through monitoring visits.

","The target population comprises 484 SMEs in eight target branches of a microfinance institution, all of whom predominantly serve manufacturing SMEs. The data collection covers all SMEs in target braches identified as to operate in the manufacturing sector. The panel data therefore represents a census rather than a sample of clients of manufacturing SMEs within the operations of the target branches.
 
SMEs in the target branches are randomly assigned to the OSH training. Randomization ensures that clients assigned to OSH and clients not assigned to OSH are, in expectation, very similar in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics. Any impact measured in the outcomes of the client group assigned to the OSH as compared to the clients not assigned to the OSH later into the program can thus be causally attributed to the intervention.

I use pair-wise matching to assign individual clients into two groups: one group receiving OSH, and another group not receiving OSH. Pairs of two are formed minimizing the Mahalanobis distance between the values of selected baseline controls balanced within pairs. In each pair one unit is randomly assigned to OSH and the other is not.  

The following variables are used to achieve balance between treated and untreated SMEs:  business sales per month, missed work days due to accidents, Investment in workplace safety, volume of last loan obtained from local microfinance organization, total value of business assets, total number of workers, and educational attainment of the entrepreneur.

We will create accounts on StackExchange with male and female usernames, and randomly assign these questions or answers to each type of account.

Does gender bias inhibit women from entering and succeeding in STEM careers? We will experimentally test for the presence of gender bias in an online mathematics community, MathStackExchange, and determine whether the magnitude of this bias depends on the reputation of a
user. On MathStackExchange, users post mathematics questions or answer others' questions. A user's reputation score rises when others vote up her question/answer or accept her answer; the reputation score decreases when others vote down the posting. We will run a randomized control trial by creating male and female usernames and randomly assigning mathematics questions and answers to each username. We will test for gender bias in evaluating users' posts by comparing the peer evaluation of posts (number of up or down votes received, reputation points earned) and peer engagement with posts (number of answers and comments), by gender. We will first conduct an experiment where gendered accounts with no reputation (new accounts) post questions or answers and compare the resulting reputation scores.  After this, we will build up the reputation of the same number of single-gender accounts, switch the username gender on a random subset, and post new questions and answers for each account. Comparison of ratings on the new question/answer at higher reputation levels will determine whether building up a reputation is a successful way to mitigate gender bias. Understanding the dynamics of gender bias and the types of evaluations that are more prone to gender bias are important for designing fair evaluation procedures in the workplace and effective policy initiatives to increase female representation in STEM and other underrepresented fields.

We will implement several treatments. 
1) We will generate mathematics questions/answers and randomly assign each question to a new account with a male or female username. The target difficulty of questions will be an advanced undergraduate level. 
2) We will build up the reputation score of single gender accounts by randomly answering questions. We will then change the
username of half of the accounts to the opposite gender and post a question/answer.

The South African National Department of Health sought to improve syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STI). An STI training was delivered at primary health care (PHC) clinics, and a cluster randomized trial compared controls to participants with three different delivery methods: 1) lecture, 2) computer, 3) paper-based.

Methods. Ten PHC clinics were randomly assigned to control and 10 to each delivery method arm. Clinicians participated in on-site training on two modules per week for three weeks. Each clinic was visited by three or four unannounced Standardized Patient (SPs) actors pre and post training. Male SPs reported symptoms of male urethritis syndrome and females SPs reported symptoms of vaginal discharge syndrome. Quality of care was measured by whether or not clinicians completed five tasks: HIV test, genital exam, correct medications, condoms, and partner notification.

Results. An average of 31% of clinicians from each PHC attended the beginning of each module. Pre-training (n=128) clinicians completed an average of 1.63 tasks. Post-training (n=114) they completed 1.73. There was no change in the number of STI tasks completed in the control arm and an 11% increase overall in the training arms relative to the control (ratio of relative risk (RRR)=1.11, 95%CI=0.67,1.84). Across delivery arms, there was a 26% increase (RRR=1.26, 95%CI=0.77, 2.06) associated with lecture, 17% increase (RRR=1.17, 95%CI=0.59,2.28) with paper-based, and 13% decrease (RRR=0.87, 95%CI=0.40,1.90) with computer arm relative to the control.

Conclusion. STI management improved for lecture and paper-based delivery methods despite low training attendance. Increases were not statistically significant.
",2013-10-31,2014-01-17,"Effectiveness of delivery methods were compared using unannounced standardized patient (SP) encounters. SPs are widely used in medical and nursing education in the United States and unannounced SPs are considered the gold standard for measuring quality of care. Unannounced SPs have been used to measure outcomes of interventions for syndromic management of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STIs)  in pharmacies and clinics. 

We measured whether or not clinicians completed five STI management tasks during an unannounced SP encounter and the primary outcome was total number completed. Professional actors who were fluent in Setswana attended a three-day SP training and one-day pilot in September 2013. Actors were trained on a standard script for vaginal discharge syndrome for women and male urethritis syndrome for men. All scripts were adapted to the actor’s age, and other personal characteristics. To prevent potential bias due to acting quality, the SPs encounters were balanced meaning that each SP visited a similar number of clinics in each arm during each time period.

After the encounters, SPs provided information about five STI tasks: correct medication, HIV test, provide condoms, partner notification slip, and genital exam. To avoid ingesting or removing drugs from the clinic, SPs disclosed at the end of the encounter. The clinicians recorded the drug name, dose, mode of administration, frequency, and duration on a Medication Slip, and all five elements had to be correct.

STI knowledge was a secondary outcome measured by tests with five, case-based, multiple choice questions per module. Module 4 was the exception, with one question withdrawn. Case-based questions began with a description of a case that the participants might encounter, and then poses questions about managing that case.
","","To compare the effectiveness of the three training delivery methods, 40 primary health care (PHCs) clinics in North West Province were randomly assigned to four parallel arms (1:1:1:1 balance): 1) delayed implementation arm that served as a control during the trial, 2) lecture, 3) computer, and 4) paper-based training delivery methods. Trainees were randomized by clinic, because the training was delivered at clinics. ","","Forty PHC clinics were randomized to four parallel arms (1:1:1:1 balance): Arm 1 was control, Arm 2 was lecture, Arm 3 was computer, and Arm 4 was paper-based. Sites were randomized in strata to control for two characteristics of PHC clinics: subdistrict, and and operating hours, meaning 24-hour services vs. fewer hours. The randomization was conducted using a random number generator in Stata  version 11 (Statacorp, 2009 College Station, TX). It was conducted on September 30, 2013, before the pre-training SP visits and knowledge tests. ",The clusters were primary health care clinics.,40 clinics,400 Standardized Patient visits,"10 clusters per arm, and 10 Standardized Patient visits per cluster","Power calculations were based on a sample size of 10 PHC clinics per arm and 10 SP visits per clinic across all time periods. We calculated the power of a test for post-training differences across arms in the percentage of SPs with correct medications assuming 35% for the control arm, 75% for lecture, and 60% for the other two delivery methods. Under three different assumptions about the random effects for facilities and for SPs, and 0.05 level of significance, the estimated power to detect a 15% difference between the lecture and other delivery arms was at least 0.8.

In order to understand why roads in relatively good condition in rural areas may not be used by buses, a minibus service was subsidized over a six-month period over a distance of 20 kilometers to serve five villages. Using randomly allocated prices for use of the bus, this experiment demonstrates that at very low prices, bus usage is high. Bus usage decreases rapidly with increased prices. However, based on the results on take-up and minibus provider surveys, the experiment demonstrates that at any price, low (with high usage) or high (with low usage), a bus service provider never breaks even on this road. This can contribute to explain why
walking or cycling is so widespread on most rural roads in Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of policy implications, this experiment explains that motorized services need to be subsidized; otherwise a road in good condition will most probably not lead to provision of service at an affordable price for the local population.",2009-07-01,2009-12-31,Minibus usage and impact of subsidy.,"","The sample site includes a cluster of five villages located 17 kilometers from a market town which offers a large weekly market, a health clinic, and access to further means of transport. In total, 542 households were listed in the five villages (in a complete census). A circular circuit track connects three of the five villages, with the other two villages within 10 minutes walking distance. This track was identified to serve as the bus route to use in picking up passengers. While there is some evidence of irregular transport on the road between the village cluster and the market town, there was no evidence of a bus or any other mode of transport intended for passengers that operated along the road connecting the village cluster and the market town.

In many developing countries, they operate in settings with weak oversight institutions and high levels of information asymmetries, further contributing to suboptimal levels of public services. One important, yet understudied, mechanism to hold them accountable is political oversight. The effects of political oversight over bureaucrats on the quality of service delivery are ambiguous. On the one hand, a growing body of empirical evidence finds that in particular in settings of weak institutions elected officials are often more accountable than their appointed counterparts, suggesting that increased political oversight may have positive effects. On the other hand, the literature points to several reasons why bureaucratic insulation may be beneficial, including pandering and patronage by politicians. My dissertation grapples with this ambiguity theoretically and empirically. Building on delegation theory, I formulate an original theory on the conditions under which we should expect an increase in political oversight to improve the quality of service delivery. I test the derived hypotheses through a field experiment, which I implement in collaboration with the Ugandan Ministry of Finance and ODI in 260 local governments in Uganda, by increasing the de facto oversight local politicians have over their bureaucratic counterparts, and, in a second treatment arm, their electoral incentives to use it to improve service delivery.

Yet, in the poorest parts of the rural world, the rates of irrigation are low. In Mozambique, only 8% of all farmers have access to irrigation. One source of Mozambique’s inability to develop widespread irrigation infrastructure has been an inability to sustain and protect previous investments in the sector.  A lack of attention to creating local institutions capable of maintaining the infrastructure has historically led to infrastructure decaying before reaching its productive potential (FAO, 2005). Forming strong institutions begins with selecting the right set of beneficiaries who can function and cooperate together to maximize productive potential of schemes.  

The evaluation aims to shed light on if different approaches to select beneficiaries can reduce elite capture and result in a more equitable distribution of benefits. However, the potential trade-offs between inclusion of smaller farmers and successful management remain an empirical question.

Proportion of small farmers
The main outcome indicator of interest is proportion of small farmers in the eligible area that are included in the scheme. We will select a random sample of 25 farmers within the eligible area to determine the distribution of cultivated land in the area. From the TIA data we see that in the region around 75% of farmers cultivate 2 or less hectares. We will compare the probabilities of these 19 small farmers to be selected under the two different selection protocols. 

Without reliable information on ICC we report the MDEs under a wide range of parameters.  Departing from a scenario where under model B half of the small farmers are included, which yields the most conservative results, the MDE of an increase in small farmers being included ranges from 0.11 -0.31.

Yield

Our sampling frame for yield will be based on the on average 15 households included in the scheme. To calculate the MDE on yield we use data from a Smallholders Survey collected in an adjacent region of Mozambique (Kondylis, Mueller, and Zhu, 2015). Mean maize revenue per hectare (MZN/ha) is 1051, standard deviation 1186 and ICC 0.10. With a baseline and one follow up for yield outcomes we should be able to detect a 20.1% increase in revenue.

The program, known as the Zomba Cash Transfer Program (ZCTP), took place in Zomba, Malawi during 2008 and 2009.  The evaluation began with baseline data collection in late 2007, with the most recent round of data collection (Round 4) taking place in 2012-2013.   

The SIHR study includes four rounds of interviews with over 3,500 young women.  The data collection effort includes household surveys, individual quantitative and qualitative interviews, academic assessments, Voluntary Counseling and Testing, school surveys, market surveys, community surveys, and health facility assessments.

The SIHR project was specifically designed to answer a number of important questions about cash transfer programs for which we had little prior evidence. First, almost all that we know about the impacts of these programs come from Latin America, where income levels are much higher and institutional capacity is vastly superior compared with many poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Second, the evidence base to effectively choose program design parameters (such as conditionality, transfer size, and the specific identity of the program beneficiary within households) is severely limited.  Third, evidence on final outcomes, such as learning, labor market outcomes, and HIV risk is lacking. Finally, long term evaluations of cash transfer programs are rare – mainly because the control groups in these evaluations are treated after a short period of time.
",2008-01-01,2009-12-30,Details in pre-analysis plan,Details in pre-analysis plan,"Between October 2007 and January 2008, baseline surveys were conducted with 3,796 girls in 176 Enumeration Areas (EAs) in Zomba district of Malawi. These girls were selected based on information collected during a listing exercise, which involved going door to door to all households in these 176 EAs. This listing exercise identified all never-married, 13-22 year old females living in the area. We sampled all dropouts and 75-100% of current school girls, where the percentage sampled depended on the age of the girl.

Out of the 3,796 girls sampled in 176 EAs, 1,225 girls in 88 treatment EAs were sampled to receive cash transfers. From December 2007 through January 2008 offers were made to all these girls and, except for a few girls who turned out to be ineligible, close to 100% accepted. The offer consisted of a household transfer and a transfer directly to the girl, as well as full payment of school fees for girls in secondary school. The household amount was randomly varied across EAs from $4/month to $10/month, with all recipients in a given EA receiving the same amount. To determine the individual transfer amount, girls participated in a lottery where they picked bottle caps out of an envelope to win an amount between $1/month and $5/month. 

We randomly assigned half of the 176 EAs to receive the intervention (treatment), and the rest serve as the control group. Within each treatment community, all never-married 13-22 year-old recent dropouts who are eligible to return to primary or secondary school are identified and always treated (with conditional cash transfers). We denote this core treatment group as T1. The same universe of would-be-eligible girls was identified in control communities, denoted by C1. Our second group of eligible girls are never married 13-22 year old school girls who are eligible to return to Standard 7-Form 4. We randomly assigned treatment communities into three categories: those where school girls receive transfers conditional on school attendance (T2.a), those where school girls receive unconditional transfers (T2.b), and finally those where no school girls receive any cash transfers (S2). In addition, within T2.a and T2.b communities, a randomly selected subset of school girls receives no transfers. The sample of untreated school girls in treatment villages, i.e. in T2.a, T2.b, and S2 only, will allow us to identify any spillover effects of the program. This same universe of would-be-eligible school girls are also identified in the control communities, denoted by C2.

However, only a very small share of parents opts for donating the cord blood upon the birth of their children. Why are donation rates so low and what can be done to increase them? How can conceptual and methodological perspectives from the social sciences provide helpful insights? 
We implement a natural field experiment in collaboration with an OB-GYN clinic. We are interested, in particular, in the effect of providing information about an activity that might not be known by most expectant parents, and in the effect of the timing at which information, as well as the request of interest to donate, is provided to these prospective parents. For example, if someone is asked early in the pregnancy, the temporal distance from the actual event might lead to both cognitive and emotional distance, such that individuals might not fully appreciate the value of their choice. Conversely, issues such as self-control may be relevant; at a certain point during the pregnancy, parents may agree on donating the cord blood upon delivery, but they might change their mind or simply overlook this issue as delivery comes close. In a condition of informational and emotional overload, the salience of this issue may also play a relevant role.
Hundreds of pregnant women visiting the clinic will be randomly assigned to the following experimental conditions: (1) the provision of information about the importance of donating cord blood; (2) the possibility for the subjects to express the (non-binding) will to donate upon delivery; and (3) reminders about the subjects’ reported intention to donate or not. Treatment groups (1) and (2) will be split in two, and subjects in each half will be treated at one of two stages of the pregnancy. The main outcome of interest is the decision on how to use the cord blood upon delivery (including the self-storage decision). We will also have access to hospital data, which will include demographics, basic health information about the subjects, and information about their pregnancy. In addition to the hospital data, information on the subjects will be obtained from a questionnaire administered at baseline, i.e., at the subjects’ first visit in their pregnancy. The main goal of the baseline survey is to obtain socio-economic information about the subjects which is not available in hospital records, such as education, occupation, and family structure. The survey will also contain items aimed at eliciting risk preferences.
The proposed study will contribute to the literature on the motivations for altruistic behavior, by providing evidence on a specific activity that has been seldom considered in the social sciences, and by devising new mechanisms to increase donations. Some of the mechanisms that we propose build on the research on the power of “soft commitments” as well as on the effect of reminders and “multiple asking”. A particular feature of this setting is that the analyzed decision includes, in addition to the non-use, both an altruistic option (donate to a public bank) and a “selfish” option (self-storage), unlike other comparable contexts such as blood or organ donations where this three-way choice set is not present. The findings will inform the scholarly debate but also be of primary relevance for organizations engaged in enhancing donations (in particular, public cord blood bank that are growing in several countries), and for policymakers.",2014-11-01,2015-12-31,"The main outcomes of interest are the response to the prompted choice questions (for women in T2, T4 and T5), whether women fill in and hand in the forms for the donation consent, and whether a donation actually occurred at delivery.

Women do not always coordinate with their families to save enough money for delivery. Furthermore, labor often begins at an unplanned time or place, leaving women without appropriate transport, supplies, and necessary childcare for other children. These factors often lead to late arrival at whatever facility is closest and affordable or, in some cases, to home delivery. Preliminary research in Nairobi revealed that nearly half the time women do not end up delivering where they intended. The central idea behind our project is that behavioral barriers to deciding where to deliver represent a significant component of delays in reaching timely, high quality maternal and newborn health care. We will conduct a pilot study in Nairobi to test simple interventions addressing behavioral and structural barriers to arriving safely at a high quality delivery facility. We will relieve behavioral barriers by encouraging pre-commitments about where to deliver and structural barriers by providing cash transfers to help offset the costs of delivery (including transport). Our hypothesis is that encouraging expecting women to pre-commit to a delivery location will reduce delays in reaching the facility and increase the quality of the facility used.

However, developing countries often face severe constraints on available electricity, which result in blackouts. In the developing world, where lighting is a major component of residential electricity consumption, energy efficient technologies, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), can reduce overall household electricity demand while permitting utilities to reach additional customers with existing supplies.  Consumers’ decisions to purchase energy efficient durables require a tradeoff between upfront and ongoing operating costs; however, evidence suggests that individuals are not maximizing the net present value of their energy-related expenditures when making purchase decisions for electricity-consuming durables. To date, empirical evidence on this phenomenon - the “energy efficiency gap” – has focused primarily on the initial purchase decision.  In contrast, we focus on the behavioral response following technology adoption, household learning with respect to energy savings, and how these impact future purchase decisions.  In order to better understand the adoption, continued use and diffusion process of the CFL technology, we conduct randomized experiments with 1,000 households in Kyrgyzstan to measure: (1) the “rebound” or behavioral responses that boost consumption and offset CFLs’ technologically feasible electricity savings, (2) the differential impacts of energy efficient technologies received for free or a positive price, and (3) the role of information spillovers in spreading information  on the energy efficient technology. Willingness to pay (WTP) was also experimentally elicited.",2013-03-01,2014-04-30,"Household-reported willingness to pay (WTP) measures, electricity usage reports from meter logs, ownership and usage of CFLs, measures of electricity-related behaviors.","","The experiment was conducted in a district with over 40,000 residential electricity customers, which is situated close to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.   Within this district, seven villages were selected due to their accessibility from Bishkek. Within the 7 villages, 110 transformers groups (TGs) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment intensities: control (zero percent of households treated), low (60% of surveyed households treated), and high (80% of surveyed households treated).   Within each transformer group, approximately 20% of households were randomly selected to be surveyed, resulting in 1,000 households participating at baseline.  Of the selected sample, households were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control group (C), the group receiving the opportunity to purchase the light bulbs at a randomly drawn price (T1), and the group receiving the light bulbs for free (T2). Assignment occurred via a random number generator. Households assigned to receive the CFL bulbs either for free or for a positive price played a willingness to pay game. We measure WTP by randomly assigning a purchase price to each household, in an experiment based on Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (1964) (BDM). BDM is particularly useful in tracing the demand for CFLs at a number of price points and estimating WTP for products that are quite price sensitive. Households were able to bid on up to four CFL bulbs, as the average household had between 5 and 6 light bulbs in total at the time of the baseline survey.  Participants were asked to state the total amount that they are willing to pay for one, two, three and four CFLs before a unit price is randomly drawn by the experimenter. If the amount they state for a number of CFLs is greater than or equal to their value at the randomly drawn price, they ought to purchase that number of bulbs at the random price. A practice round using an alternative familiar technology (pens) prior to the bidding on the product of interest helped to ensure that participants understand the method. This method is designed to create incentives for truthful value revelation (Lusk and Rousu, 2006).

The Colombian Constitutional Court has provided innovative solutions through tutela to a variety of systemic bureaucratic failures, yet, the practical impact of these innovations depends on the ability of claimants to obtain through a court order what they could not get on their own, and that depends on compliance. Compliance is commonly monitored in legal systems via indirect monitoring, where litigants are themselves responsible for alerting judges to problems. Recently courts have begun directly monitoring compliance by tracking their own orders. We conduct a cluster randomized trial designed to evaluate the effect of direct compliance monitoring. Specifically, we consider the effect of increasing health provider expectations that the Colombian public will become aware of their activities on compliance with tutela orders governing health rights. Our hypothesis is that providers that expect public scrutiny of their behavior will experience better compliance outcomes than providers who do not.

Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) can inhibit viral replication and boost immune competence, halting the progression to AIDS.  However, malnutrition is a major cause of immunodeficiency and efforts to control HIV are compromised by the presence of co-morbid malnutrition. Uganda’s national response to HIV/AIDS is recognised as strong and effective with prevalence dropping to 6% nationally and the numbers of patients receiving Antiretroviral Therapy rising to 140,000. However, prevalence is rising again in certain populations and many people living with HIV particularly in rural areas still do not have access to the Antiretroviral (ARV) services they need. Moreover, despite efforts by the Ugandan Ministry for Health to boost the nutritional aspects of HIV care a significant percentage of those attending for treatment have mild to moderate malnutrition and do not receive supplementary feeding under the present criteria. The aim of this project is to test a variety of nutrition related interventions to assess their impact on health and welfare outcomes, their impact on behavior in relation to nutrition and the mechanisms through which changes in behavior occur. Our interventions aim to both inform women on the importance of nutrition and how to fulfil their nutritional needs but also how to empower women to improve outcomes for them and their children in a sustainable way. The interventions are based around information provision to women attending clinics for HIV treatment. Specifically we consider three interventions that are simple, cost effective and scalable: 1) a nutritional information campaign; 2) cookery demonstrations on how to produce locally sourced home-made nutritious food; 3) an empowerment intervention involving videos of business success stories of women living in similar circumstances to the participants in our study. Our identification strategy aims to establish causal connections between different types of campaigns and also aims to disentangle underlying mechanisms including the existence of general information constraints; the medium of disseminating information; food insecurity and access to resources; and intra-household considerations.

1)	Completion versus drop out
2)	Performance on final exam

In addition we will also consider: 
1)	Overall course grades. Course grades are based on a combination of lecture sequence questions, 9 homework assignments, 1 final project, and 1 final exam.
2)	Activity in the course (time spent watching content, exercises attempted, etc.)
","We implement the three interventions, with some variations within each treatment and to measure the impact on student retention and performance.","In this research study, we test whether committing to a regular study time encourages enhances student performance, and whether various enforcement mechanisms can further strengthen this effect. We test whether self-efficacy messaging can boost marginalized students’ self-expectations of performance and in turn their eventual performance. Finally, we implement a tutoring program to test whether supplementing online instruction with personalized, virtual tutoring results in cost-effective learning gains.

The first of the interventions is designed to answer the question of whether committing to a regular and structured study time will encourage students to stick to that committed time, and whether this consistency in turn translates into higher eventual performance. To that end, we will provide a randomly chosen subset of students with the option to commit to a regular study time (RST). We will ask those students that opt in to record the time or times that they plan to dedicate to the course each week. However, it is not immediately obvious whether asking students to commit to a regular study time will result in them doing so in practice. For this reason, we also plan to test the impact of various enforcement mechanisms (EM). One enforcement mechanism will be a message provided to a random subset of students that the course staff can monitor usage by looking at timestamps. The second enforcement mechanism will be email reminders sent either one third of the way through the course, two thirds of the way through the course, or at both times. These reminders will encourage students to stick to their committed study time and provide an indication of how closely they have been adhering to that time. Again, the option of receiving these reminders will be randomly assigned (students will have to opt in). We plan to compare ultimate performance in the course between the control and treatment groups.

The second intervention is designed to test whether providing self-efficacy messages can improve self-expectation of performance and eventual performance, particularly among marginalized populations such as non-native English speakers and female students. To that end, we will include in the entrance survey self-efficacy messages that provide factual information on who did well in spring 2013. Self-efficacy categories include gender and primary language spoken at home. Exposure to these messages will be randomly assigned; some students will receive no message as a control. The first stage will be captured in a subsequent question in the entrance survey that measures students’ self-expectation of performance. If this first stage is strong, then we can measure the impact of receiving a self-efficacy message on eventual performance.

The final intervention is designed to test whether students would make use of personalized, virtual tutoring provided on top of the course content, and in turn whether having access to personalized, virtual tutoring has an impact on eventual performance. All students will be offered the opportunity to enter a lottery for tutoring. Of those that sign up, 500 will be randomly selected to receive tutoring with a group of 20 other students. Tutoring services will consist of weekly online group review sessions, availability for individual questions over email (on assignments or on lectures) on a weekly basis, and a final exam group review session. The tutor will in effect play the role that teaching assistants play in residential education.  We plan to monitor the level of engagement between tutors and tutees and to examine the effect of having access to a tutor on eventual performance.

In addition, the project also seeks to disentangle the relationship of savings from the success of ultra-poverty programs through the Savings Out of Ultra Poverty (SOUP) treatment, which provides both matched and non-matched savings accounts to beneficiaries.

In 2010, 3850 households in 241 villages were identified as ultra-poor through a community participatory wealth ranking process.  Villages were randomly selected to either receive the GUP or the SOUP treatment or to be a part of the comparison group. Individual households within the treatment villages were then randomly selected to receive various sub-treatments. A baseline survey was completed in February 2011, with midline surveys every six months for the next 2 years. The endline survey was completed in September 2013.  An additional agriculture-focused endline survey will be conducted in January 2014, and a follow-up survey in July 2014.

Access to safe and reliable water remains a challenge for 780 million people worldwide, most of whom live in low density rural areas. While in urban settings piped water networks working with large reservoirs and underground aquifers are viable solutions for water access, for families living in low-density rural settings an economical solution to water supply is yet to be found. In the Brazilian Northeast region we study, comprising 9 states home to 22 million rural inhabitants spread over 974,752km2, 96% of households in rural areas have inadequate or semi-inadequate water and sanitation. The region is populated by small landowners dedicated to rain-fed agriculture. For the majority of these families the main sources of water are seasonal rivers and small community reservoirs at the foot of hills which replenish during the rainy season. Vulnerability to drought is very high, and families cope with water scarcity by restricting use, depleting savings to purchase water, and migrating temporarily or even permanently. Even when water is available during the rainy season, in terms of health, drinking surface water has a high likelihood of being contaminated causing children to suffer from chronic diarrhea and other illnesses that prevent absorption of micronutrients essential to physical growth and cognitive development. In this context, we conduct an impact evaluation of a novel water technology being rolled out on a large scale by the Brazilian Government to address water access in the rural Northeast. It consists of providing households (free of charge) with a large residential rain-fed water cistern to households in rural areas lacking other water sources (No piped water, no pre-existing water cistern). The cistern intervention we study consists of a 16,000 liter reinforced concrete cistern for residential use, which is filled during the rainy season with water running from the house’s rooftop, and – in theory – should provide families enough water for cooking and drinking during the dry season. The cistern technology was a proposal of the NGO community in Brazil as a solution to water access in the region after a major drought in the late 1990’s exposed profound structural water vulnerabilities. Since 2003, the Brazilian government has been working with a network of organizations on a program to install one million roof-fed rainwater cisterns that will serve roughly five million rural people in the region. With support from the Federal Government and a host of other organizations, over 500,000 cisterns have been built to date. In spite of billions of dollars spent on this initiative nationwide, a rigorous randomized control trial of the adequacy of this technology and its impacts at household level has not been performed up to now. We address key questions about effects of the cistern on water availability, water quality, children’s health, labor market outcomes, and educational outcomes.

Does exposure to the concept of atheism affect religiosity? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to arguments of the style made by the “New Atheists” impact selfreported and implicit religiosity measures. The present documents outlines the analyses to be conducted to answer this question.",2015-04-25,2015-06-15,"1. Self-reported religiosity
Self-reported religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. Following Shariff, et al (2008), we ask a series of 6 questions intended to gauge religiosity. Individuals are asked to rate the extent they agree with each of the following statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree):
 My personal religious beliefs are very important to me;
 My religion or faith is an important part of my identity;
 If someone wanted to understand who I am as a person, my religion or faith would be very important to that;
 I believe strongly in the teachings of my religion or faith;
 I believe in God;
 I consider myself a religious person

2. Implicit religiosity
Implicit religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. We employ a single-target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) adapted from (but not identical to) the design used by Shariff et al.(2008). The ST-IAT is a computer-based sorting task that uses response time to measure unconscious associations with a target concept. In each block of the ST-IAT, subjects sort three categories of words to the left- and right-hand sides of the screen: synonyms of “real”, synonyms of “imaginary”, and words associated with religion. All language used in the task was vetted for comprehension with the sample population during several pilot sessions. In one block, the subjects sort the religious words and synonyms of “real” to the same side. In a second block, the subjects sort religious words and synonyms of “imaginary” to the same side. The order in which these two blocks occur is randomized. The ST-IAT design assumes that subjects will more quickly sort target words to the side that represents their implicit association with the target. As a manipulation check for the ST-IAT, we also administer ST-IATs using alternatively the names of cartoon characters familiar to most Kenyans and the names of natural landmarks in Kenya. We hypothesize that individuals should be relatively faster to associate cartoons with the concept imaginary and faster to associate natural landmarks with the concept real.

3. Cantril Ladder
To assess how religion may influence an individual’s sense of status, we present participants with a Cantril ladder, which asks participants where they would rate their current life compared to the best possible life they can imagine for themselves, both now and in five years by indicating where they stand (will stand) on a picture of a ladder with steps labeled 0 to 10.

4. Tolerance
We adapt a series of questions from the World Values Survey asking participants “Of the following groups of people, which would you not like to have as neighbors?”
 Drug addicts
 People of a different race
 People who have AIDS
 Immigrants / foreign workers
 Homosexuals
 People of a different religion
 Atheists/people with no religion
 Heavy drinkers
 Unmarried couples living together
 People who speak a different language

5. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
To assess the possible effect of the primes on affect, individuals complete questions from the PANAS evaluating negative affect after viewing the primes. On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 100 (very much), subjects are asked “How much do you feel...”
 “Distressed, at this moment?”
 “Upset, at this moment?”
 “Guilty, at this moment?”
 “Ashamed, at this moment?’
 “Hostile, at this moment?”
 “Irritable, at this moment?”
 “Nervous, at this moment?”
 “Jittery, at this moment?”
 “Scared, at this moment?”
 “Afraid, at this moment?”
 “Frustrated, at this moment?”
 “Stressed, at this moment?”

6. Demographics
We ask individuals to report their gender, age and religious affiliation.","Self-reported Religiosity:
We evaluate the impact of priming on each of the questions individually, and test for joint significance using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). In addition, we will analyze a weighted-average index based on the methodology in Anderson (2008). Finally, we will also examine impact of priming on any latent factors identified using factor analysis restricting the analysis to factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and using a varimax rotation.

Implicit Religiosity: 
Using the result of the ST-IAT described above, for each individual we will calculate a D-score as the difference between the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""real"" and the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""imaginary"" divided by the pooled standard deviation. Latency (response time) is recorded in milliseconds and shorter latency indicates a stronger implicit association. A lower D-score represents a stronger belief in the validity of religious concepts. 

Following the recommendations in Greenwald, et al (2003), we will exclude participants for whom more than 10% of responses are below 300 ms, as well as all responses over 10,000 ms. Individuals who initially respond incorrectly in a trial are required to press the correct response before proceeding to the next trial. We measure latency as the total time from beginning the trial to the entry of a correct response, effectively penalizing incorrect responses with longer latencies (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). To check the robustness of our results, we will also analyze the reports using the approach of Lowes et al. (2015). Instead of dropping responses over 10,000 ms, we will winsorize reponse times to 3,000 ms and replace response times for trials that were initially incorrect with the block mean response time plus the block standard deviation.

Cantril Ladder: We will calculate z-scores for responses to both the present-date and 5-year Cantril ladder question.

WVS Tolerance: We will analyze individual responses and test joint significant with SUR regression; in addition, we will calculate both aggregate and weighted average indexes across all responses.

PANAS: We will evaluate whether priming impacted affect by analyzing individual responses and testing for joint significance with SUR regression; in addition, we will analyze the summary indices of this measure. We will also use PANAS results as a dimension of heterogeneity.","1.  Sampling
The study was conducted at the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics (Busara) in Nairobi, Kenya, a facility specially designed for social science studies. Busara maintains an active subject pool of more than 7,000 Nairobi residents. For the present study, 318 subjects who had previously signed-up to be part of the Busara subjet pool were recruited from local universities using SMS and phone calls and were informed that they would be paid KES 300 (approx. USD 7.20 PPP)1. Subjects were told that they were invited to participate in a study about their behavior and preferences. Recruitment was limited to university students to ensure comprehension of the arguments contained in primes. Restricting participation to University students also ensures comprehension English. Although Universities do not typically require an official test of English proficiency, matriculating students are expected to be proficient in written and spoken English, and much of the instruction is in English. Additionally, Busara has confirmed through previous studies that the vast majority of Kenyan university students are highly proficient in English. The sample includes 183 males and 133 females. All subjects were over 18 years of age, with a mean age of 22 and a maximum age of 26.

To control for heterogeneity in religious background, we restricted the sample to Christians by omitting individuals identified as ethnically Nubian from recruitment. Since most Muslims in the Busara subject pool belong to this ethnicity, we believed this to be the best way to identify Christians while avoiding any issues of self-selection that might arise by asking individuals their religion before participation. As described below, 24 individuals in the study either failed to report a religion identified as “no religion” or identified as “other,” and 2 individuals identified as Muslim. We will control for this fact by restricting our analysis as described below.

2. Experimental Procedure
After receiving a text message inviting them to participate in the study, individuals came to the Busara lab in Nairobi, Kenya, for experimental sessions lasting approximately one and half hours. Each session included up to 25 participants. Sessions were administered by two female Kenyan research assistants, who spoke English and Swahili fluently and were trained in helping subjects with comprehension. The experiment was conducted in English. 

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 25 computer workstations with partitions on three sides, so that they were unable to see or speak with the other subjects. Within each session, individuals were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. All of the treatments and measures were implemented on HP TouchSmart 310 desktop computers running Windows 7. Each participant wore headphones and watched the video prime on his or her own computer. Subjects used the touch screen exclusively to mitigate effects of individual differences in experiences using a mouse and keyboard. All treatments were implemented using z-Tree software (Fischbacher 2007).

The primary focus is on a mobile money lock-box, held within a bank account, itself linked to and accessed through a mobile money platform.

The key parameters are the share of between school variance (rho_S). We have no prior data on which to draw this estimate so we assume conservative range of [0.05 0.2]. 
We assume that net recruitment at the school produces 20 parents who sign up for the savings products. 

We also assume that baseline data can explain about 30% of the variance of the outcome (we test for sensitivity to this assumption by showing the MDE-sample size locus when there are no covariates).

Given the assumptions above and a total sample size of 120 schools per arm, we have 80% power to distinguish effect sizes as small as 0.105 (at the low end of the ICC) or 0.156 at the high end of the ICC.
 
Two possible scenarios:
Firstly that uptake or compliance is considerably lower than the 20 student/families. We revise our cluster size assumptions to 10 students per cluster maintaining the baseline ICC and baseline covariate explanatory power assumptions. 

Our MDE now has the following range [0.132 0.171].

Secondly, if we assume an even more conservative scenario; no baseline covariates and an ICC of 0.4, then our MDE increases to 0.24.

This study experimentally assessed whether alcohol television storylines impact youth drinking attitudes and intentions and whether corrective epilogues can moderate this impact. 

Methods. Participants aged 14-17 completed the online study. Television episodes were professionally produced showing heavy drinking leading to either positive or negative consequences. The episode was shown alone or with an epilogue where a main character discussed the deleterious impacts of excessive drinking. Attitudes toward drinkers and drinking intentions were measured subsequently, along with reactions to the episode and demographic data.

Results. Exposure to the pro-alcohol episode led to more positive attitudes toward drinkers and greater drinking intentions but a corrective video epilogue successfully reduced this detrimental effect. However, including an epilogue after an anti-alcohol episode backfired, resulting in a boomerang effect.

Conclusions. Viewing a single television episode with a pro-alcohol message can lead to more positive attitudes toward drinkers and promote youths’ intentions to consume alcohol. The finding that a brief epilogue reduced the impact of the pro-alcohol storyline suggests easily implemented preventive strategies to counter the adverse impact of substance use portrayals in entertainment programming.

The project employed a randomized evaluation strategy in order to identify and evaluate the causal effect of providing health insurance to economic and psychological measures of welfare. We studied a randomly selected sample of metalworkers of the Kamukunji Jua Kali Association (JKA) in Nairobi, an organization comprised of an estimated 4,000 Jua Kali workers. Only adult JKA members who work in an area of Kamukunji Jua Kali that makes him or her eligible for voting rights with the JKA were eligible to participate in the research. We ran a preliminary survey including 1,392 JKA members between August 2008 and December 2010. We also ran a pilot study between Feburary 2010 and December 2010 to test the questionnaire and identify potential difficulties in the scale-up of the project.
After the census, the subjects were randomly stratified into three income groups ac- cording to household weekly income. 313 subjects with a weekly income greater than KSH 4,000 comprised the high income group. 300 subjcts with a weekly income between KSH 2,000 and KSH 4,000 comprised the middle income group. 242 subjects with a weekly income under KSH 2,000 comprised the low income group. We randomly selected subjects into one of the two treatment arms or the comparison group within each income strata.","",Please see attached pre-analysis plan.,Please see attached pre-analysis plan.,900 individuals,900 individuals,"300 control, 300 cash, 300 health insurance.",""

The intervention has three key components: First, participants are assessed along many dimensions (skills and abilities, physical and mental health, resources, etc.) to determine their barriers to self-sufficiency and to develop a personalized service plan. Second, participants are assigned to a two-person case management team (a case manager and a case aide) who will implement the customized service plan. Caseloads will be very low (16 clients/case management team), and service coordination will be comprehensive. Third, temporary financial assistance will be made available on a case-by-case basis to address potential obstacles to self-sufficiency.

The Impact of Performance Based Incentives and Biometric Devices on Improving Tuberculosis Treatment through Community Based Counselors in India,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/38,"August 18, 2014",2014-08-18 13:52:01 -0400,AEARCTR-0000038,"Clara Delavallade, clara.delavallade@gmail.com",on_going,2009-09-01,2015-12-31,"[""health"", ""labor"", """"]","","This experiment assesses whether financial incentives can increase healthcare counselors’ motivation, and therefore their detection and treatment of TB. Ninety-six counselors from Operation ASHA and 51 field extension workers from CARE India were randomly assigned to either the treatment group—which received financial rewards for each new patient enrolled in the DOTS system—or the comparison group—which received a fixed salary. After six months, the health workers were re-assigned at random to either a new treatment group, in which they were financially penalized for each patient that defaulted on their treatment, or the comparison group, in which they received a fixed salary. We are evaluating the impact of the incentives—both positive and negative—on counselors’ motivation and commitment to their job, and on the detection of and treatment compliance for TB.

In another arm of the project, we are testing the impact of improving monitoring of health worker’s efforts and patient compliance through the introduction of biometric technology in TB control centers. Operation ASHA has developed a biometric system based on a fingerprint scanner connected to a low-end computer and cellphone. Health workers as well as patients identify themselves when they come to the center. The data is then sent by SMS several times per day to a server located in Delhi, and alerts and reminders are sent to health workers when noncompliance is detected. 
We are evaluating the impact of these two strategies (performance-based incentives and the biometric monitoring tool) on the number of TB patients detected, the number of defaults, and a range of intermediary outcomes such as health workers’ motivation, provider absenteeism, and the quality of service delivery perceived by patients.",2009-09-01,2015-06-30,"
Incentives Study
The main outcomes of interest are new patient detection as well as the number of defaults. Some of the other outcomes of interest are counselor absenteeism, treatment compliance, interaction between counselor and patients which will be determined through patient surveys as well as counselor job commitment and satisfaction, which will be captured through counselor surveys.

Biometrics Study
Our main outcomes of interest will be counselors’ absenteeism, patients’ compliance with the treatment and number of defaults. 
In addition to the data also collected for the first experiment, we will conduct frequent random checks in centers operated both by treatment and control counselors. Indeed, while the biometric devices will give us data of great quality about counselors' absenteeism and the number of pills missed by the patients, our evaluation should be based on data of comparable quality across treatment and control counselors.The richness of the patient and counselor surveys will enable us to disentangle the role of various channels (including for instance more intensive follow-up with patients who missed their pill) through which the biometric devices might affect our outcomes of interest. 
","","Incentives Study
The randomization
After their first three months, counselors hired by Operation ASHA are offered one of the two types of contract 1 described below between three and nine months, and one of the two types of contract 2 after nine months.
Contracts 1: months 3-9
• Contract 1a: Fixed salary
• Contract 1b: Fixed salary (75% of contract 1a) + incentives based on detection 
Contracts 2: months 9 – onwards
• Contract 2a: Fixed salary
• Contract 2b: Fixed salary (75% of contract 2a) + incentives based on default 

At the end of three months, a counselor, who agrees to participate, can either be on a fixed salary scheme or a fixed plus detection based incentive salary scheme. Similarly, at the end of nine months, the counselors are re-randomized and they can either be on the fixed scheme or a fixed plus default based incentive salary scheme. Therefore, assignments to contracts 1 and 2 are cross-randomized, which gives a total of 4 different cases (1a – 2a; 1a – 2b; 1b – 2a; 1b – 2b). 

Biometrics:
This intervention will also be evaluated using the randomized controlled trial methodology: once they have gone through the first intervention, Operation ASHA counselors will be once again randomly allocated to two groups- counselors that receive a Biometric device at their center (treatment) and counselors that do not(control).

Since most counselors will have been included in the evaluation of both the first and the second interventions, our estimates of their impacts, obtained for identical workers and under very similar contexts, will be very comparable. This will make our cost-effectiveness calculations particularly informative, to decide which of the two traditional alternatives available to increase performance at work – incentives or monitoring – is most efficient in the context of TB eradication.","","Randomization done in office by a computer,",Individual level randomization: Health Provider (Counselor) ,"Incentives Experiment:

This approach implicitly relies on exchange via social networks. But, recent work has found that networks perform quite poorly at diffusing new seed varieties. Only 7% of farmers adopt from other farmers in their village. This compares to 40% when preferences were revealed via door-to-door sales (Emerick, 2013). These results suggest that the adoption gap – through the informal channel of social networks – is not demand driven. Rather, the existing sources of supply have not been sufficient to meet demand, or have not reached farmers with an effective demand for the new technology. In this study we ask whether coordination can explain the failure of informal exchange to efficiently allocate new seeds. We do this by testing the effectiveness of NGO-supported seed fairs on adoption. These events serve to solve coordination problems by simply bringing together original cultivators with potential adopters.

The initial experimental plan was to conduct the intervention at two after school program sites –Village Charter School and Centre Street.  However, one of the program sites, Village Charter School, ended up having unanticipated scheduling conflicts which prevented both the complete delivery of the intervention and complete post-intervention data analysis.  Participants in the intervention group at this site received, on average, fewer than 2 sessions of the 5-session class.

It is carried out in the context of attaining savings goals. We argue that savers underestimate their future ability to save and hence save too little, or stop saving altogether, in the future because savings goals at present are chosen with overconfidence. We argue that persuasive messages given at the time when a goal is made can help overconfident individuals who overestimate their own ability to reach the goals, i.e. we hypothesize that persuading savers to make more realistic savings goals at the time they formulate them will help them reach their savings goals with a higher likelihood. However, depending on the behavioral bias there may also be savers who are underconfident, i.e. individuals who underestimate their savings potential.

In each cluster 10 households were randomly sampled from client lists held at the branches of the local microfinance institution. The client list comprises current and former clients from the local microfinance institution.

Treatments are randomly assigned with respect to balance the Mahalanobis distances in baseline covariates. The 940 households were randomly assigned to either control or to one of twenty different treatment arms, such that 300 observations were assigned to control and 32 observations to each treatment arm. Thereafter the Mahalanobis distance with respect to the baseline covariates given below was calculated. Mahalanobis distance was calculated pairwise between any two treatment arms and also for each treatment arm relative to control. The random assignment was only accepted if the maximum distance to control was smaller than 0.605 and the maximum distance between any of the treatment arms was smaller than 1.322. These numbers corresponded to the 0.01 percentile of the empirical distribution of these distances.

The baseline covariates used to collect Mahalanobis balance were current savings in cash (amount in Birr), current savings with the local microfinance institution (amount in Birr), whether household is a member of an Iddir, a funeral insurance, or Equb, savings group (both binary indicators), the demographic composition of the household (measured by the number of household members between 0-5, 6-11, 11-17, 18-65 and more than 65 years of age), whether the household head is female or married (both binary indicators), the years of education of the head, the total land area under cultivation (in hectare), the total revenues from crop sales (in Birr) and the per-capita consumption expenditures (in Birr)).

Ethiopian Project on Interlinking Insurance with Credit for Agriculture,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/451,"July 22, 2014",2014-07-22 18:33:58 -0400,AEARCTR-0000451,"Craig McIntosh, ctmcintosh@ucsd.edu",on_going,2011-01-01,2014-12-01,"[""agriculture"", ""finance"", """"]","","Smallholder farmers are beset by an interlocking set of market failures, and when credit and insurance markets are missing farmers can become trapped in a low-investment equilibrium.  Risk-driven reluctance to invest in inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds may be largely responsible for the fact that Africa has not undergone a ‘green revolution’.  The obvious policy intervention to protect farmers against such risks would appear to be insurance indexed to local weather conditions, but when such products have been introduced in the field they have typically been met by surprisingly low uptake.  This project seeks to test whether a simultaneous provision of credit and insurance can solve this puzzle, thereby using innovation in financial services to spur a meaningful expansion of the use of agricultural technology.

We are providing insured credit to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.  Rather than addressing only a credit constraint (in which case risk rationing can remain a barrier) or insurance failures (which reverse the time-inconsistency problem and ask farmers to pay now in faith of a future benefit), we will test a form of rural credit that is interlinked with weather index insurance, in the sense that the latter will provide a collateral substitute.  To this end, we have implemented a two-armed randomized trial in collaboration with Ethiopia’s largest private-sector bank and largest private insurance company.  One arm offers a standalone index insurance product, and the other arm offers state-contingent loans, interlinking the provision of insurance with the provision of credit.
",2012-05-01,2014-09-01,"The primary intermediate outcome for the study is enhanced use of improved inputs, namely fertilizer and HYV seeds.  These are then pathways to the intended final outcomes, which is an increase in agricultural productivity (yield/hectare), increased ag sales and income, and improved household outcomes (consumption, schooling, and household asset ownership, decreased vulnerability).  We will also examine how the implementation of the insurance changes cooperative-level outcomes such as number of members, number and type of services offered to members, and relationship with second-tier cooperative unions.","","
The study started with a sample of 120 Primary Cooperatives in Amhara.  This sample of kebeles has been tracked for two years in a detailed household, cooperative, and kebele-level survey conducted by the Ethiopian Economics Association. We selected a sample of 20 households per kebele (18 of them cooperativized farmers, and 2 non-cooperativized) and have tracked them in two rounds of surveys, conducted in Jan-Feb of 2010 and 2011.  Two factors have reduced this sample size to the group of 62 that we are now pursuing.  First, detailed data work in the field revealed that some of the originally selected regions did not suffer from severe deficit rainfall risk and hence were not good candidates for the insurance product we have developed.  Secondly, Swiss Re (the international reinsurance company that Nyala utilizes to reinsure part of its risk exposure) has agreed to provide reinsurance cover for only 7 out of the 17 stations that cover the study area because of incomplete data at the other stations (Nyala will provide insurance at one additional station in North Wollo without reinsurance).  We have therefore restricted the sample to consist of only those kebeles that face deficit rainfall risk and are located within 15 km of the 8 project rainfall stations (20 km in the flatter terrain of West Gojam; statistical analysis shows that the correlation between yields and rainfall in stations more than 20 km away from the farmers is unacceptably low).   The number of farmers covered by this pilot remains large; roughly 15,260.  

The research design therefore is an RCT comparing 17 kebeles (villages) offered standalone insurance with 17 kebeles offered interlinked insurance and credit, where the counterfactual for both is formed by 28 control kebeles offered neither product.  The impact of the study will be tracked using two different survey instruments.  One of these is a household survey tracking 20 households per kebele (18 cooperative members, two non-members), and the other is a survey conducted at the level of the primary (kebele) cooperative.  

 As a part of the research design, as well as randomizing the placement of the treatment within study kebeles, we distributed voucher coupons to study households via a lottery system.  The amount of vouchers distributed ranges from 0 to 500 birr, and the presence of this variation in the effective price of the insurance allows us to estimate the demand curve for insurance in a statistically rigorous fashion.  In the first two years these were distributed in a manner that allowed farmers to get a very small insurance coverage for free by using only the voucher; in the third year the vouchers were reframed so that they cover a fraction of any premium payments but cannot make up the entire purchase amount.

Under these constraints, TECHO opted to select beneficiaries through a lottery system in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay, giving all eligible households in a pre-determined geographical neighborhood an equal opportunity to receive the housing upgrade in a given year. We exploit this experimental variability to assess how upgrading slums through the introduction of improved housing affects poor households’ living conditions. Thus, we rely on a randomized controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of upgraded housing in slum areas on a set of outcomes of interest. TECHO first selected a set of eligible settlements (i.e., communities). TECHO then conducted a census to identify the eligible households in these settlements (i.e., those households poor enough to be given priority).

According to the Energy Information Administration, American households with an annual income below $20,000 spent over 7.9% of their income on energy. This number is below 0.3% for households earning more than $120,000 per year.  As a result, policies that aim to internalize negative externalities in the energy sector are notoriously regressive (Grainger and Kolstad, 2010). Currently, this regressivity in the energy sector is addressed with two types of policies: increasing block pricing and means-tested subsidized tariffs. In practice, the redistribution gains from these policies are modest (Borenstein, 2012). Every year, thousands of low-income households are simply not able to afford energy services, fall into arrears, and end up at risk of being disconnected. 

Across the country, institutions such as the Fuel Fund of Maryland and the Dollar Energy Fund  help families struggling with their utility bills. Their mission is to provide small grants to low-income households that have received a disconnection notice from their utility. Though bill assistance plays an important role, it is a last resort solution to maintain energy services and does not address the long-term issue of how to help low-income households cope with high and often increasing energy bills. Policies that help families reduce their energy demand can thus potentially play an important role in this context. One such policy is energy education. 

For decades, analysts have argued that there are opportunities to lower energy demand through low-cost behavior change (Diezt et al. 2009). Though the barriers to such opportunities are still hotly debated (Allcott and Greenstone, 2012), recent evidence suggests that providing energy information can lead to short-term and long-term reduction in energy usage (Allcott, 2011, Allcott and Rogers 2014, Houde et al. 2013). Yet important research questions still exist about the effectiveness of different technologies for providing information to customers and about specific impacts on low-income households. For instance, energy education that aims to engage households in active learning about low-cost behavior change has been called a promising solution (Wilson and Dowlatabadi, 2007), but its effectiveness is still mostly unknown. 

Using a randomized experiment, we investigate the role of energy education provided to low-income households that face the risk of disconnection from their utility services. Our first goal is to evaluate whether energy education can lead to a decrease in energy demand. Our second goal is to investigate the effectiveness of different educational technologies, particularly comparing online education to in-person programs.
",2014-10-20,2015-07-06,"There are two outcome variables we are interested in measuring:
1. Compliance decision with the treatment
2. Energy/cost savings due to the treatment
","We define our quantities of interest based on the following formulas. The data for month(s) where a household was disconnected will be treated as missing (not zero).  

E[Btu/m | connected,online]- E[Btu/m| connected,control]
E[Btu/m| connected,onsite]- E[Btu/m | connected,control]

where Btu measures the combined gas and electricity consumption of a household (kWh and therms are converted to Btu using standard conversion factors). We will separately examine gas (therms) and electricity (kWh) consumption as a robustness check. We will also calculate the average daily usage level, where we assume consumption is uniform across a month and only measure days that the household was connected. This interpolation allows us to keep the number of days right around connection/disconnection. Additionally, we will see how consumption changes before and after connection for everyone. This is not experimental, but is interesting descriptive evidence.
","This is a randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms (online and on site) and a control group. Group assignments are made on a week-location basis, where clients registered on the same location and same week are randomized to the same group. Completing the training is presented as mandatory to participants, but the Fuel Fund does not deny financial assistance to clients who complied with the financial requirements but did not complete the Watt Watchers training. This means that compliance is an issue that the analysis has to take into consideration. 

Additionally, for clients who got assigned to one of the treatment arms, we have an encouragement component also by week-location. We are randomizing the registration letters that clients receive after they get assigned to the on site or online versions of the course. This means that one third of these clients will receive a simple confirmation letter; a third will receive the same letter with the chance to enter a lottery for an autographed Ravens football if they complete their WW training; the final third will also receive the same letter, and the chance to enter a lottery for a gift card of approximately the same value as the Ravens football ($250) if they complete their WW training.

Finally, part of the WW curriculum involves rewarding onsite participants with a gift bag containing energy-related goods after the completion of the course. We want to understand the impact of this gift on energy consumption. For this, we will randomize online participants to receive or not the same gift bag after they complete the training.   
","","The randomization was done at a week-location level, prior to the beginning of the data collection. This means that all locations (main office and local agencies) will follow a pre-defined calendar of randomization. This calendar will inform the case worker in charge of the first interaction with the client in which group he/she should be placed. Every week the assignment changes, but all clients registering in the same location during one week will be placed in the same group. The schedule was developed such that the cycles in all location are neither predictable nor consistent (e.g., online-onsite-control-online-onsite-control...), although we guaranteed that every location receives at least one of each groups in every month. Each location follows an independent schedule. This means that, for instance, when the Salvation Army is on an “online week”, the main office might be on an “onsite week”.",The randomization units are week-locations: all participants registering on a specific week and location get assigned to the same group.,"Standard errors will be clustered at the month-office level and at the office level as a robustness check.

In the unlikely scenario of only 25% compliance to treatment, the minimum detectable effect is 10%, keeping us confident that we will have a large enough sample to establish generalizable results. Early indications suggest that after three months of program, compliance is at 32.9% for the onsite and 38.4% for the online group. These numbers were collected prior to implementing the encouragement letters, making it reasonable to expect compliance to increase in the next weeks. The Fuel Fund of Maryland expected the training to have about a 5-7% effect as suggested by previous, non-experimental evaluations. "

The Creative Learning and Teaching (CLT) program works as follows.  At the beginning of the academic year, the organization recruits and trains members of the CLT in each village.  Initially, these individuals subject students to tests in three subjects: (1) English, (2) Hindi, and (3) mathematics.

(1) subjects' subsequent decision to run or not run for public office (binary variable); 
(2) conditional on filing an official certificate of candidacy, their vote-share margin of victory; 
(3) a binary variable for winning an elective seat.","","I will implement a randomized controlled trial of a leadership training workshop with incentives among youth interested in running for political office. The experiment will be conducted in Sorsogon Province, Philippines, where the experimental design has been piloted this last year (Aug. 2013--Sep. 2014). It will be implemented in partnership with the Angara Centre for Law and Economics (ACLE) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA).  The intervention will occur a year before the October 2016 Village Level Elections. Standing in and winning election are the key outcomes of interest.

Sampling. The sample will consist of N=900 Filipino residents of Sorsogon Province, qualified and interested in running for an elective post in the village council as first-time candidates. (See statistical power calculations in a separate section below.)

Treatments. Study participants will be randomly assigned to a control condition (no workshop) or one of two workshop treatments---a workshop with unconditional incentives or a workshop with conditional incentives. Assignment will take account of baseline measures of public service motivation (PSM) to maximize statistical power.

Workshop Interventions. The leadership training workshop has three goals: (1) provide basic leadership skills; (2) give participants a chance to run a simulated village council meeting in which they will brainstorm a flagship project; and (3) serve as a screening mechanism by which study participants can reveal their 'type' (i.e. competence and honesty, as will be explained below), as they perform in the various workshop tasks and in the simulation of the council meeting.

To prevent differential take-up across treatment arms, participants invited to the workshop will not be informed of the incentives until after the workshop is over. Moreover, unbeknownst to participants, performance in the workshop will be monitored and evaluated, and will be assigned scores based on a scoring rubric. This is to prevent differential behavior among participants across treatment arms, due to awareness of being monitored.

Workshop staff members will be assigning scores. If a participant is assigned to the group with unconditional incentive, then he shall receive the incentive regardless of his performance score. On the other hand, if a participant is assigned to a group with conditional incentive, then he shall receive the incentive only if his performance score is above a pre-determined cutoff, which is known only to the Principal Investigator (PI).

The incentive is a combination of two things: (1) a plaque of merit awarded at the end of the workshop, (2) and a few (less than 10 pcs.) of standard-sized campaign posters, should they decide to file an official certificate of candidacy. 

Data Collection and Measurement of Political Selection. The field experiment begins with a call for applications by ACLE to the leadership training workshop. The study team will hand out posters and invitation letters to schools, offices of incumbent village officials, as well as to different civic organizations, to capture as many applicants as possible. Posters and letters will provide a general description of the workshop, application guidelines, as well as information on a pre-screening session. Applicants will be informed that selection to the workshop is random.

The pre-screening session is designed to measure personal characteristics of applicants before any random assignment to treatment groups occurred. The session will involve a series of tests designed to measure two broad categories of personal characteristics: competence and honesty. Competence is subcategorized into public service motivation (using Perry's PSM Index (Perry, 1996)), aptitude (based on Wechsler's Test of Memory for Digit Span (Wechsler, 1987), and on a Matrices Test adapted from (Ariely et al., 2009)), personality (using the Big 5 Personality Index (John, 1990; John, Naumann and Soto, 2008)), and aspiration (Kasser and Ryan's Aspiration Index (Kasser and Ryan, 1996)). Honesty will be measured in terms of participants' propensity to cheat in a simple roll-a-die game a la Fischbacher and Follmi-Heusi (2013); Hanna and Wang (2013)).

Applicants who successfully completed the pre-screening session will be enrolled as study participants and randomly assigned into the treatment groups described above. Political selection will be measured in several stages after randomization, as follows:

Stage 1: Selection into the workshop.
Stage 2: Filing a certificate of candidacy. (After the workshop, but before the elections.)
Stage 3: Indicator for winning an elective post and vote-share margin of victory.

The proposed study examines how perceptions of relative state effectiveness determine a citizen's engagement with state and non-state actors. The first component of the study introduces a range of ""exposure treatments"" to individuals in Pakistan, a country that offers an excellent study context. The treatments vary from information provision about state and non-state initiatives versus a placebo information treatment. The study tests whether these interventions change a citizens' beliefs and attitudes towards state and non-state actors. 

The second component of the study will offer several levels of intensity of treatment -- from pure information, to demonstration, to facilitating access to state services. We will then measure the change in citizens' beliefs and attitudes along with impacts on the citizens’ actual engagement with each actor. These ideas raise the possibility of a two-way feedback between the effectiveness of the state and citizens' attitudes towards it.",2014-12-01,2016-09-30,"Our set of interventions - moving from light to heavy treatments - will help map out the nature and extent to which differing degrees of (positive) exposure to state (and non-state) actors impacts state (non-state) trust and engagement. For each intervention evaluating the impact on both state and non-state actors will allow us to detect direct and spillover effects. In the light treatment, separately using positive state and non-state information, will allow us to examine whether the effects are symmetric or not. In the medium (and heavy) treatments, we will use the “state-heavy” and “state-light” variation to see the elasticity of trust in state and non-state actors with respect to varying levels of exposure of state activities. Moreover, since we will examine state-service specific perceptions and outcomes as well, we will be able to examine whether providing a positive exposure to one state service leads to a positive movement on the other service as well (a ""service spillover"" effect).

With states like Pakistan increasingly concerned about citizen disengagement, it is important to understand what factors promote trust in and re-engagement with the state. Whether positive policy innovations can help and if so, whether these need to be directly experienced by the citizen or the knowledge that the state is improving its effectiveness is sufficient. Since the trend away from state authority is not simply a Pakistan-specific phenomenon, the lessons from this study are likely to be of interest to a wide audience of policymakers and academics.","","Respondents will participate in a field-based experiment to examine the effects of information treatments, which provide fact-based information on the behavior and ideology of state actors, on the level of trust and respect citizens hold for these state actors. The intent of the games is to identify the influences on citizens’ trust in state and non-state actors. They are being developed based on common behavioral trust games that ask respondents to make a monetary allocation with a given amount to various state and non-state actors. The experiment measures the change in their allocations given more positive or negative information relating to various the actors. Surveys will also be designed to gather more specifics in terms of the reasons for the allocation decisions of the players and also of perceptions of service provision by state and non-state actors. A double-blind design will ensure that allocation decisions cannot be traced back to each individual and that state and non-state counterparts will not have any knowledge of the identity of the respondents. 

The study will recruit individuals through door-to-door household visits, use of land records system and lists of callers into the police helpline system as part of the study population to be given one of the three treatments or assigned to the control group. These systems are further explained below.

Along with the information treatment, two other treatments will be introduced to reduce barriers to accessing newly developed state services for respondents. These treatments are added to understand how additional exposure, not just information, to the state affects perceptions of state and non-state actors. 

The second treatment will move beyond delivering simple information to making it more credible and persuasive by detailing new services—namely a computerized land record system and the police emergency helpline system—and educating respondents about accessing them. The computerized land registration management information system (LRMIS) in Punjab puts in place a reliable, efficient, and transparent system for maintaining land records. The system records all transactions and provides access to these records for the relevant population at designated service centers. The crime reporting helpline system by the police can be used during periods of emergency, threat or victimization. This system has been prevalent in Western countries for several decades (i.e. “911” service in the U.S. and Canada). The main component of this intervention, the helpline, will record all citizen complaints and direct designated police officers to respond to these complaints. In visits to respondents, we will explain step-by-step all processes associated with availing these services and how beneficial they have been to others. The first treatment consists of purely information about state or non-state actors (as was done in the first stage of the intervention). In contrast to the first treatment, this treatment seeks to engage the respondents via direct demonstration of new and positive services. In the case of land record system, we will demonstrate the system on a tablet but will recommend respondents visit service centers to further engage with the system. 

The third treatment will directly reduce the transaction costs of engaging with state dispute resolution services. Specifically, we will offer ""legal triage"" to respondents. Initial evidence through the police helpline system shows calls with requests for legal advice. Our discussions with lawyers also suggest that such services would be of help and reduce the costs of accessing often burdensome state services. Trained professionals will develop a guidebook that will discuss resolution options for common types of cases and law students and/or paralegals will be trained and made available to assist respondents with their cases. While we haven't finalized the delivery logistics, options being considered include vouchers for consultation hours or a series of household visits by professionals. With respondents in all three treatments and a control group, we will collect data on perception of state and non-state actors, results of behavioral game play and use of state and non-state services. Additional surveys will be developed to be used at baseline and endline of these interventions. These documents will be added as an amendment when they are finished being prepared.
 
Details of Game Format
Two games that will be primarily used to test changes in perceptions of trustworthiness of state and non-state actors when given information treatments include the fund dictator game and the investment game.

Fund Dictator Game: Individuals are told that a given state or non-state actor has put an unknown portion of a given amount in a sealed envelope. The game allows participating individuals to make a choice between a fixed amount and this envelope given by the state or non-state actor. 
  
Investment Game: 
This allows participants to anonymously and confidentially invest some, or, or none of a specified amount representing their day’s income in a hypothetical scheme run by a type of state or non-state actors, knowing that their return is based on a measure of the actors’ effectiveness. ","We will be using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with each of the three proposed types of treatments offered to a randomly selected subset of individuals. We expect to estimate “intent-to-treat” effects for all of our treatments. Our general specification will be: 
Y_it= ∝ + β_1∙〖Treat〗_i+ β_2  ∙〖Post〗_t+ β_3  ∙〖〖Post〗_t×Treat〗_i+ ε_i
Y_it  is the outcome variable for individual i at time t ∈(0,1). 〖Treat〗_i  is the treatment dummy, and 〖Post〗_t is the post-treatment period dummy. β_3  is our coefficient of interest giving us the average treatment effect of the intervention. CERP will manage all surveying activities.  

We will focus on a range of outcome variables using a combination of survey, experimental games and administrative data. We are interested in capturing subjective outcomes such as perceptions of state or non-state effectiveness or preference towards state or non-state actors as well as real outcomes such as take-up of state services, frequency of usage of state-services or dispute status. We will administer baseline surveys to all respondents and conduct follow-up surveys to track take up and usage of state initiatives as well as the status of disputes over a 1-2 year period. We will access administrative data to verify certain self-reported outcomes on state service usage. In addition to outcome measures, we will collect basic information on households (age, income, etc.) to serve as control variables if necessary (e.g. in cases of imbalance in key variables from randomization). 

In the pilot study, we observed effects of roughly 0.2 standard deviations (sd) for experimental game outcomes from a simple information provision treatment. To conduct power calculations for the full study, we take this effect size as the benchmark for the low-intensity treatment; as we increase the treatment intensity, we expect stronger effects (0.25 sd for the medium-intensity and 0.4 sd for high-intensity treatments). Based on these assumptions, power calculations reveal that we will require a total of 2,100 respondents, with 500 respondents for the low-intensity treatment, 450 for the medium-intensity treatment, and 500 for the high-intensity treatment (assuming 50 percent take up, though we expect it to be higher), and 650 respondents in the control group.","We will identify neighborhoods with low to middle income households and visit individual households to gather a sample population to participate in the games.

Geographic disparities in this regard are important, since in rural areas this percentage only reaches 3,7%.

Schools were affected to either treatment or control groups within geographical strata corresponding to the administrative unit they belonged to and their location (rural or urban).

1. Transfers to the woman vs. the man in the household. First, half of the transfers were made to the woman, while the other half were made to the man. This feature allows us to identify the differential welfare effects of gender-specific cash transfers. 

2. Lump-sum transfers vs. monthly installments. Second, half of the transfers were lump sum, and the other half was paid in 9 monthly installments. By randomizing the month in which the lump sum transfer was made, we kept the discounted present value of the lump-sum and installment transfers similar across the overall lump sum and monthly installment groups.

3. Large vs. small transfers. Finally, a proportion (28%) of the transfers were $1,100 in magnitude, while the remainder were $300. This manipulation allows us to estimate the effect of transfer magnitude on welfare outcomes. 

These three treatment arms are fully crossed with each other, except that the $1,100 transfers were made to existing recipients of $300 transfers in the form of a $800 top-up that was delivered as a stream of payments after respondents had already been told that they would receive $300 transfers. The pre-analysis plan outlines how this issue is dealt with in the analysis. 

Evaluation Design 

Sampling and Identification strategy 

To establish a causal relationship between the program and changes in outcomes, this study uses a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). We first identified Rarieda as an intervention area because it has (i) high poverty rates according to census data, and (ii) sufficient M-Pesa access to make transfers feasible. We then identified 100 villages based on the overall prevalence of eligible households in the village. In these villages, we identified 1,500 eligible households, with eligibility determined by residing in a home made of mud, grass, and other non-solid materials. These criteria are simple, objective, and transparent, maximizing accountability. The criteria were not pre-announced to avoid “gaming” of the eligibility rules. We then randomized on two levels -- across villages, and within villages. Specifically, 50 villages were randomly assigned to be treatment villages, while the other 50 were pure control villages. In each of the latter, we surveyed 10 households that did not receive a cash transfer. Within treatment villages, we conducted a within-village randomization: 50% of eligible households were randomly assigned a cash transfer; the other 50% received no transfer (GD will seek to make transfers to this group after the study). This strategy allows us to identify spillover effects (detailed in the pre-analysis plan). 

Spillover effects 

We use three approaches to quantify spillover effects. First, we used pure control villages to quantify within-village spillovers. Comparing control households in treatment villages to those in pure control villages identifies within-village spillover effects. Second, we identify spillover effects across villages. Note that these effects could potentially be even more pronounced than within villages, if, for instance, entire villages are affected by weather shocks. Using GPS data on village location, we can identify cross-village spillovers, under the assumption that these spillovers are geographically correlated. Third, a separate village-level survey elicited general equilibrium effects of the intervention at the level of the local economy; we surveyed residents of the village on prices, labor supply, wages, crime, investment, community relations (e.g. perceived fairness of targeting criteria) and power dynamics. 

Data collection methods and instruments 

Data was collected at baseline and one year after the intervention. A midline with a subset of questions was administered to a sample of respondents each month after the intervention. Trained interviewers visited the households; both the primary male and the primary female of the household were interviewed (separately). Surveys were administered on Netbooks using the Blaise survey software. Following standard IPA procedure, we performed backchecks consisting of 10% of the survey, with a focus on non-changing information, on 10% of all interviews. This procedure was known to field officers ex ante. Saliva samples were collected using the Salivette (Sarstedt, Germany), which has been used extensively in psychological and medical research, and more recently in randomized trials in developing countries similar to this one. It requires the respondent to chew on a sterile cellulose swab, which is then centrifuged and analyzed for salivary cortisol. 

Power calculation 

The sample size of 500 individuals in each of the treatment, control, and pure control conditions was chosen based on a power calculation, which showed that a sample of 1,000 individuals is sufficient to detect effect sizes of 0.2 SD for all treatment vs. pure control households with 89% power. Different treatment arms within the treatment groups (male vs. female recipient, lump-sum vs. monthly, large vs. small transfers) can be compared with 60% power. 

Risk and treatment of attrition 

Attrition was not a significant concern in this study because it became evident early on in GD’s work in Kenya that respondents were highly interested in maintaining relations with GiveDirectly in the hope of receiving future transfers (although these are never promised). Nevertheless, we used five approaches to control attrition. First, the survey contained a detailed tracking module developed by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the NGO implementing the fieldwork. IPA and GD collaborated closely throughout the study to facilitate tracking. Second, we incentivized survey completion through a small appreciation gift (a jar of cooking fat); in addition, respondents earned money from the economic games in the survey. Third, in our power calculations, an attrition rate of 20% would still result in a power of 80%. In fact, we only observed 3% attrition between the two visits of the baseline. Finally, we control for attrition econometrically in the analysis, as detailed in the pre-analysis plan.","",Computerized randomization in office.,household (treatment vs. spillover households) and village (treatment/spillover vs. pure control villages),100 villags,1500 households,"500 households treatment, 500 households spillover, 500 households pure control","0.2 SD, 80%"

This includes physical, psychological, sexual, financial and emotional abuse. Domestic violence is estimated to cost the public purse in excess of £5 billion every year (Walby, 2004), not including the intangible, long-term, costs of trauma and emotional suffering for children, families and communities.
Project 360 is the first randomised-control trial of a multi-agency approach to dealing with repeat domestic violence in the UK. 
Following current procedure, households assessed as high risk by responding police officers are provided with assistance from the Domestic Abuse Support Team (DAST). However, these households make up only four percent of the cases mentioned above. The remaining medium and low risk households do not receive DAST assistance unless seven or more incidents occur within the preceding 365 days. Project 360 extends the service currently offered through DAST by: 1) providing an intervention to households which do not qualify under current procedures; 2) reducing the response time of first contact with victims (currently seven days, on average, for DAST); 3) for households with children, expanding the intervention to pass information directly to schools.
The experimental design of Project 360 will allow us to estimate the causal effect of the intervention on a number of outcomes reflecting the impact on households, victims and children. Combining these outcomes with information on public expenditures we will provide a full cost-benefit analysis of the programme.

","The target group of this study is children who are initially in the age group of 8-14 years, following the requirements of the MBF program. To calculate the sample size we assume that 60 children (two MBF intervention sessions of size 35 each, 5 children are lost to follow up per session) are enrolled from each treatment village. After analysing various child outcomes such as educational attainment, school enrolment, and test scores from secondary data sources, our final sample size is calculated on the basis of India Human Development Survey (2004-05) mathematics test scores. Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.10, in order to detect a 15% difference of maths scores (effect size = 0.21) between treatment and control group children (Duflo et. al 2008 show that average effect sizes in educational outcomes/test scores tend to vary between 0.22 and 0.65), we need roughly 40 villages per group per district, based on a two-sided test having 5% level of significance and 80% power.
At baseline, a random sample of 200 eligible children (or all children if there are less than 200) in each treatment village, and a random sample of 70 eligible children in each control village will be surveyed. A larger sample is purposely targeted in treatment villages during baseline to estimate the determinants of enrolment in the program later. Then, following their standard operational procedure, MBF will spend two months in each treatment village advertising and encouraging parents to ask their children (and directly children too) to enrol in the 3 year sports-based program. Thereafter, eligible children in treatment villages are expected to self-select into the program. During the enrolment period, no eligible child will be denied participation. However, once enough children are enrolled, there will be no new enrolees during the subsequent 3 years, during which the program will meet weekly with enrolled children. 
Our sample size calculations assume a 15% attrition rate. Consequently, our follow up survey rounds will therefore cover approximately 60 enrolled children in each treatment and 60 children from each control village. To evaluate program spillover effects of the program on eligible children in treatment villages who do not participate in the program, in addition to the 70 enrolled children (reduced to 60 later because of attrition), we would survey 60 randomly selected, non-enrolled, eligible children in each treatment village during subsequent survey rounds. Therefore, each follow-up survey round will cover on average 120 children (60 enrolled + 60 non-enrolled) in each treatment village and 60 children in each control village.

To answer this question, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) partnered with the Private Education Development Network (PEDN) to design and implement the Super Savers Program. A school based savings program, the Super Savers Program aimed to connect savings and education in Uganda. Along with program implementation, IPA directed a research study to assess the program’s impact. 

The study used a randomized control design to measure the impact of different variations of the Super Savers Program. In one variation, students who participated received their savings in cash at school, with some encouragement to invest their savings towards school expenditures. In the second variation, the savings payout was provided in a more restrictive form: vouchers requiring an education-related purchase. Students at a third group of schools served as a comparison. 

The program variation which included a savings payout in the form of cash generated higher savings in the program accounts. When combined with a parent outreach program, the program led to an increase in the percentage of children in the classroom with basic scholastic materials and an 8% increase in test scores on an exam covering language and math skills. We find no effect for the fully-committed account, and we find no effect for either account on attendance, enrollment, or non-cognitive skills. 

The results from this study contribute to existing research in two ways: First, while we know that savings programs are particularly effective when tied to a specific goal—such as education—putting too many restrictions on payouts can be counteractive. Second, reaching out to parents and households can be an important way to improve primary education.

An education transfer of 812 Lempiras/year (about US$50) was available to families with children ages 6 to 12  who were enrolled and regularly attended grades 1-4. A health transfer of 644 Lempiras/year (about US$40)  was available to families with children under 3 and pregnant mothers who regularly attended health centers. In practice, school enrollment (but not attendance) was enforced as a condition of the payments, while no health benefits were suspended for failure to attend health centers.

The research aims to measure the direct impact of a microfranchising intervention on program participants and the indirect impacts of the program on pre-existing businesses in the area of the intervention. 

To measure the direct impact on program participants, the research conducts two surveys of participants in the second wave of a micofranchising program being implemented by in six Nairobi neighborhoods. The two surveys comprise: a baseline survey of applicants who will subsequently be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control (non-treated comparison) group and an endline impact evaluation survey of up to 2000 women who complete the baseline survey. The two treatment groups are designed to compare the relative impact of access to the microfranchising opportunity and access to a cash grant of comparable value. The research will focus on the impact of the treatment opportunities on young women’s labor supply, income and expenditures, savings, empowerment and self-actualization, and overall well-being. 

To measure the indirect impact on pre-existing businesses, the research project also includes an enterprise census and a monthly enterprise survey.  The census will identify businesses operating in the sectors and neighborhoods of interest, a subset of whom will then be invited to join the enterprise survey.  The enterprise survey will be conducted on a monthly basis surrounding the start of the microfranchising program and will focus on the employment, labor supply, revenues and profits of the firm.

To explore potential spillovers, our baseline survey includes detailed questions on local friendships which will allow us to map each girl’s social network, and determine the number of friends in the program who were randomly assigned to the treatment group(s).  Stratification on age and ethnicity will allow us to explore treatment effect heterogeneity.

Our design also allows us to estimate spillover effects on pre-existing businesses.  This novel aspect of our design addresses a major concern in evaluations of entrepreneurship and credit interventions:  estimates of direct effects may overstate overall social impacts if new enterprises adversely affect the profits of existing firms.  To explore this question, we collect panel data on pre-existing businesses in sectors and neighborhoods in which the new microfranchises will operate, and in comparison sectors and neighborhoods which will not be in direct competition with the microfranchisees.

First, the growth of Government-to-Person (G2P) payment schemes in developing countries has created a need for strategies to make payments cheaply in rural areas where there is limited financial infrastructure. Second, financial inclusion is limited among the rural poor; while G2P programs are increasing the number of poor banked, few users actively use their accounts.

In Peru, the national conditional cash transfer program, JUNTOS, faces this double challenge. Payment (through bank branch or cash transporter) represents a costly logistical operation for the program, and the majority of users have to travel out of their district to receive payment. On the other hand, only a small fraction of users actively use their savings accounts, due to the difficult of accessing the branch and lack of information. To address these problems, Peru’s National Bank is rolling out a branchless banking agent network in village stores and local municipalities that offers withdrawal, remittance and purchase services. In a complementary intervention, we will offer workshops to improve the level of trust and empowerment of JUNTOS users in the banking system. 

We hypothesize that the introduction of the agents will lower the transaction costs of the cash transfer payments for both the program and for users, and that this will increase both JUNTOS users’ use of their accounts and total savings; we expect this effect to be larger when agents are combined with training. We will test these hypotheses using a randomized trial with two levels of randomization. Randomization among 59 districts will determine 30 districts that receive the agent intervention and 29 districts which act as controls for the duration of the intervention. Within the 30 treatment districts, there will be a subset of 140 villages selected to either receive the trust intervention workshop or not, with 70 in each group.

•	Savings account balance

3. A final report for the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion, JUNTOS Programme, State Bank of Peru, Institute of Peruvian Studies, World Bank (CGAP) and the Gates Foundation 

We anticipate the intervention itself to bring about the following outcomes 

1. Lowering the transaction costs for users via the installation of the Branchless Banking agents closer to the users´ homes will increase the use of the account
2. This effect on the increased use of the accounts will be increased in the case of villages receiving financial education treatment 
3. The increased use of the account will also be reflected in increased levels of savings which will in turn affect consumption patterns in favour of spending on more durable goods 

Finally, a key outcome of the evaluation is to be able to make policy recommendations on the efficacy of the use of both the Branchless Banking Agents and the kind of messaging in financial education that is most effective to reach users of the government cash transfer programme on a national level. This therefore has implications for some 700,000 JUNTOS beneficiaries directly, and 1,000,000 individuals to include their families. ","
1. RCT Design: Justification & Explication 

The primary motivation for using an RCT to select those receiving the intervention and those not, is to eliminate selection bias, thereby increasing the precision with which we can measure the precision of the intervention. When offering a new programme to all beneficiaries at the same time, it is difficult to know whether any ""impacts"" - positive or negative - are attributable to the intervention itself (in our case the installation of the Branchless Banking Agent, or the introduction of Training workshops) or due to other reasons, that may or may not be related to the programme. The use of a rigorously designed experiment with randomized selection of districts and villages that receive the two levels of treatment enable us to attribute whatever change our outcome indicators to the intervention directly. 

Despite the random assignment of treatment and control groups, it is possible that differences may arise between the two groups. In order to create statistically equal groups, we use control variables to identify the most precise impacts of the treatment. 

5.2 The design of the experiment

We shall carry out an experimental evaluation in 59 districts across 3 departments in the sierra of Peru (Puno, Cusco, Apurimac and Ayacucho). 

First of all, to select the districts to be randomized, we first needed to establish (1) The type of JUNTOS district in which we want to focus the intervention and (2) Which districts have adequate conditions for the installation of the agents. 

Thanks to preliminary research realised in Phase 1 of the research, we have concluded that the most important factors for the adequate functioning of the agents are (a) sufficient data connection of one of the two main network providers (b) sufficient liquidity to manage the JUNTOS payout. In order to establish which districts had these characteristics, we conducted a pre-selection of districts to verify signal and survey potential agents to determine the number of users that each could manage. Only those districts which fulfilled this criteria in the Southern Sierra region were then pre-selected to be randomized. Following this, we also took out districts which had less than 50 users who would be receiving their payout in the bank branch of another district. None of the districts in the sample had (a) a bank branch of their own or (b) an agent or (c) only beneficiaries who received from a transporter. Finally, we took out districts that were located in provinces which had more than 60% of districts with agents installed in order to diminish the possibility of contamination via agent installation in control districts. 

Only when we had the list of eligible districts did we then randomize treatment and control. Randomization consisted of two stages. 

1.1 Phase 1 Randomization - District Level 

The first level of randomization is to offer the installation of the agents, at district level. The sample consists of 59 districts - 30 treatment districts and 29 controls, with approximately 300 beneficiary households per district. 

We ensure balance between the two groups of districts on the basis of administrative data on the average distance to district capitals from villages of each district. Furthermore, we balance the number of districts that receive via branch and transporter across treatment and control. Apart from this, we ensure that socio-economic characteristics, such as literacy rates among JUNTOS users, are balanced between the two groups. 

In each treatment district, we coordinate with the JUNTOS programme to re-enforce the new, official message of the programme (Resolución N° 044—2013-MIDIS, abril 2013) that beneficiaries may use their accounts without limitations and can take out or leave money in their accounts without risk of suspension from the programme. This message shall be conveyed across treatment and control groups, at the same time as installation is taking place in treatment. 

Following this the treatment districts will be assigned to have promoters of the Branchless Banking Agent product, known as the Agente MultiRed, who will go to the district capitals to promote the product in municipalities and shops, that have been identified as having sufficient cash in the pre-screening. 

2.2. Stage 2 of randomization: village level 

In stage two of the randomization, inside the districts that receive agents, we shall pilot a trust intervention in 70 villages. Each financial education treatment will consist of a workshop of three hours with reminder SMS messages being sent afterwards to re-inforce the message provided in the workshop. 

(1) The first treatment will emphasize the benefits of savings via a financial education that focuses on the reasons and justifications for saving. 

(2)  The second treatment is a second type of financial education, focused on the improvement of the level of trust that users have in the financial system. This second workshop will put more emphasis on creating a culture of use of the technology, by enabling beneficiaries to see the examples of their community leaders using the technology, and having the regulatory system explained to them. 

(3)	1 and 2 combined to see the effects of synergies 

(4)	A control, where beneficiaries will only receive information about the existence of the agent and the mechanics of their use. 

We will stratify the second phase of randomization in order to ensure balance between villages, using administrative data provided by BN, SISFOH and JUNTOS. Among the variables here are the distances from villages to district capitals (where agents will be installed) so as to test whether effects will be greater on villages that have a greater time saved in getting to their paypoints. Stratification will assure sufficient power and balance between these sub-populations. BN will grant us data on the universe of JUNTOS beneficiaries, which shall be merged in the analysis with socio-economic information on the same users.

1.3  Control Groups 

One of the requirements for the rigourosity of the evaluation is to guarantee that the control groups are not contaminated. For control districts at the first level of randomization, these districts will not have Branchless Banking Agents installed during the period of the intervention. At the second level of randomization, those villages in control will not be provided with any financial education beyond technical training on how to use the machine in the shops themselves. 


We work to assure that there is no contamination in the first phase via close communication with BN in Lima and the intervention zone, so as tu ensure that the evaluation does not clash with their expansion plan in the districts which are included in the impact evaluation. 

In order to avoid contamination in the second treatment, we make sure that only users in the villages assigned to receive the workshops receive them, via close coordination with local JUNTOS facilitators at a local level, who know where each user comes from. In addition, we ensure good communication with the implementors of financial education - the Institute of Peruvian Studies. IPA will continue to monitor the implementation of the program during the intervention period. At the start of the workshops, IPA will ask users for some data on their friends in other villages. At the endline, IPA will encorporate questions on the knowledge of beneficiaries regarding the content of other treatments to see if there was spill over of knowledge from one to another. ","",Randomization done in office using STATA with stratification on the travel time to current payment point of JUNTOS users.,"There are two levels of randomization. The first randomization will be made on district unit and within the districts of the treatment group a second randomization will be made on villages or ""centros poblados"" unit.

","The cluster contains 59 districts.
For village level randomization we will randomize to include 4000 users across the three treatments and one control. This will be around 220 villages in total. ","About 22,500 households","30 districts treatment, 29 districts control.","[This may need changing]

The survey sample will be 6,000 surveys across the three treatment groups, with 2000 surveys per arm. 

We will have two outcome  variables for which we rely on results from survey data. 

1. The first is increase in total savings (i.e. bank savings and reported savings in other areas). 

At district level (i.e. for a comparison between those who received agents and those who did not) we need to see an increase of S./37.5, assuming a control group mean of S./59.5 and a standard deviation of S/.320.03, power of 80% and intracluster correlation of 0.01. 

At village level (i.e. for a comparison of those who received the training intervention on top of the agent intervention and those who received solely the agent intervention), we need to see an increase of S/.36.5 assuming the same means, SD and power as above but with an ICC of 0.02.

2. The second is we need to see an increase in the spending on durable goods. 

At district level we need to see an increase of S/.61.08 in spending on durables within a year, assuming a control group mean of  S/.272.92, a standard deviation of S/.523.73 and an ICC of 0.01. 

At village level we expect to see an effect of S./59.08 when there is an ICC of 0.02, but with SD, power and control group means the same as above. 

For budgeting purposes, we assume that only 90% of attempted surveys will be successfully administered, and we will therefore attempt a total of 6,600 surveys. Some 220 per district. "

People who were part of the control group were also contacted by phone and informed that they were part of a second phase program that would begin later and they would be contacted again with information on the new registration dates. In order to ensure the programs’ participant quotas were met, there were other selection mechanisms into the program running in parallel to the experiment described here. These mechanisms largely rely on TFIRM’s network of retail clients and partners, who select and propose potential trainees, who are generally then invited to participate.


Second experiment

Of the originally invited 888, 772 did not attend the training program, so we randomly selected 623 (80%) of them to be invited a second time. For this second cohort, only the retailing course was available, but this time it was offered in 4 locations throughout the city: “Montalban”, “Caricuao”, “Catia (The Silsa)” and “Sabana Grande”. People who were re-contacted could not choose the venue, but were instead assigned to the one closest to their home.


Follow-up

A year after starting the first course (May 2011), the same market research company tried to contact the original 1250 interviewees for the follow-up survey. Due to administrative considerations, a one month time limit for the follow-up survey was established. The idea was to start tracking the maximum number of participants by phone and proceed with the face-to-face interview (at home) only for those which they could not locate after 3 phone contacts. After two weeks, 411 telephone interviews were obtained, but in the following two, we were able to contact only 189 participants at home. The total follow-up sample contains 600 interviews, 48% of the initial experimental sample. Figure 1 describes the timing of the data collection process as well as the interventions.

For the ""informal group meeting"" intervention, we randomly select 186 households living in another location (an administrative subdivision of radius 2 hours by foot). We ask them to identify the most important social group that they belong to (e.g., ROSCAs, clan or family groups, church groups). Upon approval by the chairperson (obtained in 92 percent of the cases), we then organize a presentation at the usual meeting time and place of the group.
For the information intervention, we randomly select 389 households. 
Two control groups are considered. First, we consider the 283 households living in the same location as participants receiving an informal group meeting. Despite them not being invited to a meeting, it is possible that some of them attend. This is due to the fact that they belong to the same group as our participants. This group thus measures the potential spillovers inherent in organizing group meetings. Second, 359 households from another location formed a ""purer"" control group.

This is enough to detect the massive returns due to pesticide or cattle growing. Pesticides can double yields (Behera and Singh (1999). In qualitative interviews, farmers from this area report that a 5 months bull is worth 8,000 to 10,000 Ksh, while a 3 year bull is worth 60,000 to 100,000 Ksh. In the conservative case of 60,000 (/12 months / average household size of 3.7)=1,351Ksh/month. These sample sizes are thus sufficient to detect the returns to these high-return technologies."

We use a field experiment with Indian manufacturing workers to test whether relative pay comparisons affect effort and labor supply. Workers perform individual production tasks, but are organized into distinct teams - defined by the type of product they produce. We randomize teams to receive either compressed wages (where all workers earn the same random daily wage) or heterogeneous wages (where each team member is paid a different wage according to his baseline productivity level). This enables effort comparisons across workers who receive the same absolute wage, but vary in the wages of their co-workers. In addition, we introduce heterogeneity in the extent to which pay differences across co-workers seem justified.",2014-09-01,2015-12-31,"(1) Daily production for each worker, measured by a count of the total items produced in a day  

(2) Daily attendance of each worker, including time of arrival and departure from worksite

(3) Total labor earnings of each worker

(4) Team-level output","Total labor earnings of each worker will be constructed from data from worksite payroll as well as end line survey responses about outside activities on days when workers were absent. 
","Once the training period is over, workers' baseline productivity is assessed, and each worker is assigned a relative productivity rank within their team. We then randomize teams into one of four wage treatments:

(1)	Each team member is paid according to his baseline productivity, with the wages for the lowest, middle and highest productivity workers being w_L, w_M and w_H respectively, where w_training < w_L < w_M < w_H  

(2)	All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_L

(3)	All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_M

(4)	All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_H
","To test whether relative pay comparisons affect worker effort and utility, we construct a design to accomplish two goals: 

(i) for each worker, define a clear reference group of co-workers for relative pay comparisons; 
(ii) be able to compare outcomes for workers whose absolute pay levels are the same, but who vary in their co-workers' (reference group) wages.  

Workers will be employed full-time at worksites in low-skilled manufacturing tasks.  Within each worksite, workers will be randomly divided into up to ""teams"", with 3 workers in each team. Within a team, all 3 teammates will perform the same production task. Each team at the worksite will have a unique task - for example, one team will make rope, another team will produce incense sticks, another team will weave floor mats, etc. - with a total of up to 10 tasks per worksite. Production will be an individual activity - teammates will sit together but will not need to do any work jointly. Rather, the purpose is that each worker's 2 teammates will be the only other people at the worksite making the same product, and will therefore be the most salient reference group for wage comparisons.

Before assigning treatment status, workers will undergo a ""training period."" During this period, all workers will receive the same daily wage. At the start of training, workers will be told that their post-training wages may depend on their output during training. Once training ends, workers' baseline productivities will be assessed, given their relative productivity ranks in the team: low, medium, or high. 
 
Teams will then be randomized into one of four wage treatments: 

(i)	Heterogeneous: Each team member is paid according to his baseline productivity. The wages for the lowest, middle, and highest productivity workers are wL, wM and wH respectively, where w_training < w_L < w_M < w_H  
(ii)	Compressed_L: All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_L (the ""low"" wage).
(iii)	Compressed_M: All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_M (the ""medium"" wage).
(iv)	Compressed_H: All team members are paid the same daily wage of w_H (the ""high"" wage).

After being randomized into these treatments at the end of training, each person will work under his assigned wage until his fixed employment contract ends. We are sure to emphasize throughout the contract period that there will be absolutely no offers of future employment.

The design incorporates three important sources of heterogeneity. First, the various tasks differ in how easy it is to observe the output of one's teammates. We will stratify wage treatment assignment by task, generating variation in the observability of co-worker output within each treatment cell. Second, since output is continuous while productivity rankings are discrete, there will be natural variation in how much a worker's productivity level differs from that of his teammates, creating variation in {wage difference}/{productivity difference} ratios within each cell. Lastly, given that workers at each worksite are recruited from multiple villages, there is variation in the strength of pre-existing relationships and social ties between workers across teams. 

In our analysis, we aim to separately identify effects on the intensive (effort) and extensive (attendance) margins. Measuring the response on attendance captures the extensive margin. However, isolating the intensive margin is more difficult.  If there are attendance differences, then regressions of output on treatment status conditional on attendance will be biased. This is the standard selection problem in Heckman (1979). We propose to solve the selection problem by constructing an instrument for attendance based on weather shocks and the difficulty of traveling to the worksite. When it rains, it becomes much harder for workers to travel to the worksites, thus increasing the likelihood of an absence.  However, the exclusion restriction for rainfall alone might not be satisfied; on rainy days, workers who do manage come to the site might be less productive. To solve this problem, we plan to interact rainfall with measures of the distance and material of the roads between each worker's village and the worksite. For each worksite, we recruit workers from at least three villages, thus giving us within worksite-day variation in the difficulty in coming to work.

The main outcome variable of our interest is employee turnover. We choose to target turnover with our experimental treatment because it has blighted our study firm for years, averaging at an upwards of 80% per year and costing about 400 Euros per quit.

While informality is often seen as an obstacle to business growth and economic development, very little is known on the relative importance of this constraint. The benefits of formality may include increased access to financial services, markets, government support programs and networks. 

Other development obstacles are often considered complementary to informality. One problem for MSMEs in Malawi is that household and business resources tend to be strongly intertwined, resulting in the depletion of working capital. Hence, spurring the separation of household and business money by informing about its benefits and offering business bank accounts with access to the SME Department of a Bank, may have strong positive effects in adding value to business registration. This study also examines whether male and female-owned enterprises gain equally from registration, and whether the effects of registration are heterogeneous on other dimensions. 

The target group of this study consists of 3,000 informal MSMEs located in Blantyre and Lilongwe, the major commercial cities in Malawi. These firms were identified through several listing exercises and selected based on a pre-defined set of criteria. The researchers stratified firms in the sample by a set of measures, including gender, location, and sector and then randomly assigned them to either one of the treatment arms or the control group. The study intervention consists of three treatment arms (totalling 2,250 firms) and one control group (750 firms). In order to test the impact of business registration on business performance, all 2,250 firms in the treatment group were offered costless registration with the Department of the Registrar General (DRG) – which is the main step to firm formalization in Malawi. Out of these, 750 firms were solely offered the DRG registration. A random group of 300 firms was also offered to register for taxes and obtain a Tax Payable Identification Number (TPIN) from the Malawian Tax Authority, allowing the researchers to test the additional value, if any, of this step in the formalization process. The remaining 1,200 firms in the treatment group were invited to information sessions by a local bank on the benefits of separating business from household money and offered business savings accounts.
The team is collecting extensive data – the first  two follow-up surveys have been completed and two more rounds of follow-up surveys are planned for 2014  - to estimate the impact of the different treatment arms on business expansion, access to finance, and productivity of MSMEs. The outcomes of interest include measures of firms’ financial performance, investments in the business, survival rates, number and skill composition of employees, access to finance, number of customers, and harassment levels.

The outputs generated by this study will be directly relevant for policy. Malawi is currently streamlining its registration process to increase the registration rate amongst MSMEs. The Business Registration Impact Evaluation (BRIE) is a direct response to the interest of the Government of Malawi in evaluating whether or not business registration improves business performance. The government will therefore use the results of this study to promote registration (if positive impact is detected) or to identify the corresponding bottlenecks that affect enterprise performance (if no impact is identified).",2012-04-01,2012-09-01,"business registration, tax registration, (business) bank accounts, loans obtained, other financial products, business investment, employment, revenues, profits, harassment level","",Randomized Control Trial,"",Stratified Randomization,Firms,0,"3,000 Firms","750= Business Registration Certificate (BRC) alone; 300= BRC + Tax Payer Identification Number; 1,200= BRC + Information Sessions + Business Bank Accounts; 750= Control Group",""

The programme will operate in rural areas of two states in Nigeria: Jigawa and Zamfara.

By providing cash to poor women, it is expected that the programme will enable them to buy more and better quality food and also to spend money on education and health. The project, which will be implemented by Save the Children (SC) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) will provide a child development grant (CDG) of approximately 3,500 Naira (£14) a month to mothers, from the time they are confirmed to be pregnant until the child is two years old.

The design of the evaluation is such that there will be a control group, a first treatment group of mothers that receive the unconditional cash grant plus basic, ""low intensity"" nutritional education and advice to mothers, and in another treatment arm this unconditional cash transfer will be supplemented by the provision of ""high intensity"" nutritional education and advice to mothers.

We aim to rigorously test the impact of the programme on key indicators, as well as to compare the difference in key indicators when the unconditional cash transfers are delivered with high verses low intensity nutritional education and advice to mothers.

The key evaluation questions as are:

i)	Has the programme contributed to reducing stunting, wasting and underweight in children and how does this vary by gender of the child?
ii)	Has the programme contributed to an improvement in the food security and dietary diversity?
iii)	Has the programme contributed to a reduction in the percentage of households liquidating productive assets in the hungry season or in the face of economic stress?
iv)	Has the programme contributed to changes in men and women’s knowledge about nutrition and infant and young child feeding?

The women chosen to be in the sample from the  initial household listing will be of two types:
1. those pregnant during the listing and so eligible for the grant immediately
2. those estimated to be the most likely to become pregnant during the evaluation period.","Since the extremely high prevalence of stunting in Northern Nigeria is one of the main concerns that the CDGP aims to address, the power calculation detailed below is based on the measurement of changes in child height-for-age z scores (HAZ). They are measured in standard deviations and calculated as follows:

HAZ=measured height-median height in reference population for same age and sex/standard deviation of reference population

The reference population used here is the 2006 WHO Multi-Centre Growth Reference Study, which combines observations from a range of different ethnic groups from six countries to construct a universal growth standard. A HAZ of 0 means that the child’s height is normal for their age and sex. According to global convention a score of less than -2 indicates stunting and a score of less than -3 indicates severe stunting.

In order to predict the likely size of the effect that the CDGP may have on HAZ, we conducted a review of other impact evaluations of unconditional and conditional cash transfer programs and nutrition education interventions. Based on existing evidence, we have conducted our power calculations with the aim of detecting a 0.2 SD change in HAZ or children in target households in the three years between baseline and endline. This is the expected change between Treatment Group 1 and the control group. Similarly, we aim to detect a 0.2 SD change in HAZ between Treatment Group 1 and Treatment Group 2.

We have estimated the required sample size per cluster assuming 210 clusters. As we have two treatment groups and one control group, this translates to 70 clusters per treatment type. All calculations are based on a power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05.

With a MDE of .2, and an assumed ICC of .1 (.05), we require 12(8) pregnant women per cluster to be surveyed. This gives a total of 2520 (1680) pregnant women in total to include in the evaluation.

Using estimates derived from the NDHS for Nigeria (2008) we expect to be able to find such numbers of pregnant women at baseline in the surveyed states.

The effect of affordable daycare on health and economic well-being over the life course in India: A cluster-randomized impact evaluation study,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/774,"July 15, 2015",2015-07-15 12:54:58 -0400,AEARCTR-0000774,"Sam Harper, sam.harper@mcgill.ca",on_going,2014-10-01,2017-09-30,"[""education"", ""health"", ""labor"", """"]","","There are structural barriers to women's economic participation and empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable daycare services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable daycare services is a potentially important policy lever for reducing gender inequality and improving health and socioeconomic well-being over the life-course. Access to daycare might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women, improve education for girls caring for younger siblings, and promote nutrition and learning among children. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of daycare programs over the life-course in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based daycare program on health and economic well-being over the life-course among women and children living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the daycare system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.",2015-08-01,2017-09-30,"We will measure the impact of our intervention on self-reported empowerment (self-esteem, role in decision-making, freedom of mobility, and control of material resources), measured via in-person survey. Other outcomes include labor market attachment (employment status, occupation, hours worked), economic status (personal and household income), time use, and mental health (depressive symptoms). Additionally, we will measure nutritional status (stunting, wasting, underweight) among children less than six years of age, as well as educational attainment and literacy among school-aged children.","Regarding the measurement of empowerment, we adopted the conceptual approach of Kabeer, which incorporates both the personal and political dimensions of empowerment, and developed indicators that captured ""women's sense of self‐worth and identity, their willingness to question their own subordinate status, their control over their own lives and their voice and influence within the family"". We constructed indicators of empowerment, adapted from the Indian NFHS4 whenever possible to facilitate comparability, which encompassed four domains: (1) decision making within the family and control over income (e.g., Who decides how the money you earn will be used: mainly you, mainly your husband, or you and your husband jointly?); (2) freedom of movement in the public domain (e.g., Are you usually permitted to go to the following places on your own, only if someone accompanies you, or not at all?); (3) participation in community and public life (e.g., Are you a member of any type of association, group or club which holds regular meetings?); (4) and views and attitudes on critical gender issues (e.g., Please tell me if you agree or disagree with each statement: A married woman should be allowed to work outside the home if she wants to). We tested the face validity of the questionnaire by consulting individuals with local expertise and added, deleted, and revised existing indicators. We pilot tested the questionnaire in sample of approximately 200 women. The questionnaire was modified accordingly based on the results of the pilot study. A data reduction technique (i.e., factor analysis) will be used to provide a summary score. We plan to test the reliability of empowerment measures during the second survey wave. 

Use of time was measured using a structured questionnaire, adapted from a study by Beaman et al. (2012), that asked respondents whether they spent any time in the past 24 hours on specific activities (e.g., gathering fuel or firewood), how much time they spent on each activity, and whether this amount reflected the usual amount of time spent on the activity. The questionnaire also asks whether respondents were paid in cash or in-kind for the activities they engaged in.

The survey asks about employment experiences, including whether respondents work, their occupation, the type of work, the quantity of work, whether they are paid for their work in cash or in-kind, and what they do with their children while working. We will ask about household income received in the past 12 months from various categories (e.g., agricultural income, business income, rents, remittances, government payments). Household wealth will be measured using a series of questions about ownership of specific assets (e.g., telephone, bicycle, radio), environmental conditions (e.g., type of water source, sanitation facilities), and housing characteristics, (e.g., number of rooms, materials used for housing construction). Additionally, we will ask respondents about savings accounts held by household members, including for each account the type of account, its purpose, the total value, and whether the respondent can use the account to make purchases. 

With respect to anthropometry, the equipment used will be calibrated daily before home or hospital visits. Two anthropometrists will record data independently and compare values. The average of these two values is taken, and any large discrepancies can be resolved by a first repeat measurement. Length is measured using a length board (sometimes called an infantometer) placed on a flat, stable surface such as a table. To measure height, a height board (sometimes called a stadiometer) will be mounted at a right angle between a level floor and against a straight, vertical surface such as a wall or pillar. If a child is less than 2 years old (or if age is unknown, less than 85 cm), recumbent length will be measured. If the child is aged 2 years or older (or if age is unknown, greater than 85 cm) and able to stand, standing height will be measured. The child's shoes, socks, and hair ornaments will be removed. Braids will be undone if they will interfere with the measurement of length/height. The Shorr height board is will be used to measure recumbent length. Adult and child heights will be measured using the Harpenden Portable Stadiometer (range 65-206 cm). For weight measurement tared weighing will be performed for children less than 2 years old. If the child is 2 years or older the will be weighed alone (if the child can stand still). The SECA 814 digital scale (up to 200kg) will be used to measure child weight. To measure arm circumference, any clothing covering the child's arms will be removed. The midpoint of the child's upper left arm will be calculated and marked with pen on the child’s arm. The child's arm will be straightened and the tape used to measure the circumference. While measuring, the tape should be flat on the child's arm. The measurement should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Circumferences will be measured using a metal tape (range 0-200 cm). The suggested instrument for measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is the MUAC Tape (UNICEF Item No. 145600 Arm circumference insertion tape/pack of 50). ","The intervention, i.e. the introduction of balwadis, will be randomly assigned to 80 of the 160 hamlets. The remaining 80 hamlets will serve as comparison group. The survey, which measures the study outcomes, will be administered at the baseline (before the intervention starts), at the mid-line (one year after the intervention starts), and at the end-line (when the intervention/program ends). ","",Randomization was done in office by a computer (using Stata software's random number generator),"We randomly assigned the 160 hamlets to treatment or control stratified by block (Badgaon, Girwa, Jhadol, Herwara, Kotra) because we wanted to prevent random variations in the distributions of blocks across treatment groups from confounding effects (e.g., if women in treated hamlets were more likely to reside in blocks with more economic opportunities). A random integer was assigned to each of the five blocks and each of the 160 hamlets using a random number generator.",160 village hamlets,3200 individuals,80 treated hamlets; 80 control hamlets,"In the context of clustered treatment assignment the minimum detectable effect (MDE, Bloom 1984) will vary as a function of the extent of clustering. We calculated a range of MDEs under different clustering scenarios for our primary binary outcome, labor force participation, conditional on the number of clusters (j) the number of subjects per cluster (n) and the degree of clustering (estimated by the intra-cluster correlation coefficient [ICC]). We focus on estimating the MDE for a pre-specified level of power, based on our initial design of j=160 clusters (80 treated, 80 comparison) and n=20 subjects per cluster. 

Plugging in values for type II error (kappa=0.20), type I error (alpha=0.05), a balanced 50% allocation fraction (P=0.5), the standard deviation of the outcome in the control population (labour force participation rate of 30%, so SD=.3*(1-.3)=.21), and sample size (N=3200), this gives a MDE of 0.03, meaning that we could detect a treatment effect as small as 3 percentage points (33% or 27% in the treated vs. 30% in the control).

Cluster randomization will increase the MDE because it reduces precision, and this is a function of the degree of clustering, as measured by the intra-cluster correlation (ICC). Effectively, this deflates the precision so we will either need to be satisfied with a larger MDE or a bigger sample to estimate the same MDE. If we revise the scenario above to take into account the clustered design, fixing the clusters again to 80 treated and 80 untreated, increasing the ICC increases the MDE.

For k=160 clusters and n=20 individuals per cluster, the MDE for various ICCs are calculated as:

ICC=0.00, MDE=0.05
ICC=0.05, MDE=0.07
ICC=0.10, MDE=0.08
ICC=0.20, MDE=0.10

For degrees of clustering typical in social science surveys (between 0.01 and 0.05, Bloom 2005), the present design of 160 clusters and 20 individuals per cluster still provides us with MDEs that seem feasible and relevant (5 to 7 percentage point differences for binary outcomes with baseline proportions of around 0.3).

The vast majority do so through recruiters and placement agencies that facilitate temporary employment in countries across Asia and the Middle East. These agencies support migrants starting with pre-departure paperwork and training through repatriation, and are therefore a crucial determinant of a worker’s migration experience. Potential migrants ostensibly have a great deal of choice between agencies – there are over 400 formally registered firms in Indonesia – and in theory, competition between these firms should drive out poorly performing agencies. Yet existing evidence suggests that agency quality is highly variable, and that many agencies engage in exploitative practices. This could be due to market power at the local level, or informational failures, both of which would hamper competitive pressures. This study will evaluate how making additional information on firm quality available to migrants workers impacts workers' migration choices, migrant worker welfare, and the structure of the migration market at the local level.

The second product will take the form of a short comic book. The goal of the comic book is to help communicate in an accessible manner the fact that placement agency quality, and not just fate, matters in affecting migration outcomes.

It will do this by means of a randomized experiment in Colombia, which will allocate firms into three groups: a control group who just receive a diagnostic on their management practices, an individualized treatment group who receive one-on-one consulting to improve 5 different processes: Logistics, Human Resources, Finance, Marketing and Sales, and Production; and a treatment group in which management improvements will be implemented in a small group setting, analogous to agricultural extension, with firms learning from one another. The interventions take place over a 6 month period and are intended to improve growth, productivity, and the scope for innovation in these businesses.",2014-02-01,2015-05-30,"We will examine impacts at three key levels of the causal chain: first whether the interventions lead to improvements in management practices; second, whether these improvements in management practices lead to changes in factory operations (such as changes in machine downtime rates, electricity usage, quality defect rates, and labor hours); and thirdly, whether these changes ultimately lead to higher production, improved productivity, greater sales, and higher profitability. 

The exact measures will depend on data availability, and particularly on what measures can be reliably compared across different groups without being affected by the intervention. We plan in particular to focus on four key outcomes:
* Management practices
* Production levels
* Employment levels
* Sales
","","Following the diagnostic, we dropped firms with fewer than 10 workers, to leave a sample of 159 firms for the experiment. We then formed matched triplets of firms, choosing this grouping in a way to minimize the Mahalanobis distance between firms in a triplet in terms of their geographic location, size, labor productivity, and management practices. This took place in November 2013. Then within each triplet, firms were randomly allocated to a control group and two treatment groups. Each group consists of 53 firms.","","Randomization within triplets was done in a semi-public setting, with representatives of government and industry observing.",Randomization at the level of the individual firm.,No clusters,159 firms,"53 firms to control, 53 to individual consulting treatment, 53 to group consulting treatment","The proposed study details with a single industry, and collects very detailed data at a monthly frequency. These two features help to ensure we have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects of interest. In particular, we have more than 5 times the number of firms in each treatment group as was the case in the Bloom et al. (2013) study, which was still able to detect significant impacts.
First consider our power to detect a change in management practices. During the diagnostic phase, the index collected by CNP of all management practices has a mean of 0.46 (out of 1) and standard deviation of 0.10.  Even without any controls we would still have 80 percent power to detect a change of approximately 5.5 percentage points in the proportion of desirable management practices that are implemented – and power to detect even smaller impacts once additional controls are used. Given the intensity of the intervention and the evidence from India, we expect at least this much of a change in management practices.
Second, consider our power to detect an increase in productivity. Labor productivity at baseline has a mean of 30.76 and standard deviation of 18.29. Labor productivity here is annual sales (in millions of Colombian pesos) per employee, so 30.76 indicates sales per worker of approx..US$14,600. We will have this data at a monthly level, with 12 months pre-intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. Assuming an autocorrelation of 0.5 then gives us power of 95.1 percent to detect a 10% increase in productivity, again without taking into account power gains from the random assignment within matched triplets. This allows us to detect an effect smaller than the size measured in Bloom et al. (2013), whilst allowing room for attrition to potentially reduce the sample slightly. Taken together we view these calculations as indicating we have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects of interest.

By collaborating closely with WSC, we are exploiting this geographic expansion with a two-year randomization design in parts of western and central Kenya, creating well-defined treatment and control groups. Because of differences between western and central Kenya, we expect the constraints, and ultimately the impacts in these two regions to be different. In particular, the western region is poorer, and farmers there are unlikely to reap the full benefits of WSC technologies in this liquidity-constrained environment. We will therefore also relax these liquidity constraints for some farmers in the western area by providing fertilizer, randomized at the household level. In summary, we hope to learn about two key issues: the effectiveness of a local seed company in developing technologies fine-tuned to the local agro-ecological environment, and the impact of relaxing liquidity-constraints on the poverty-reduction potential of new agricultural technologies.",2013-12-10,2016-06-30,"Adoption of improved hybrid maize seeds (Western Seed Company in particular)

The treatment was cluster-randomized to 36 clusters (18 T, 18 C) with 1,800 farm households spread across 3 (randomly selected) villages per cluster. The second treatment arm was randomized at the household level and provided a 50 kg bag of blended fertilizer, appropriate for the sample farmers' soils.","","The first level of randomization was done in an Excel spreadsheet (the clusters were paired by some basic characteristics (basic geography, agro-ecology/altitude/rainfall), and one cluster in each pair was chosen for treatment and one for control. This randomization selected demonstration plots (control 'demo plots' were excluded and no demo plot was arranged at that site).
Within a 5-km radius of these demonstration plots, local administrative officials listed the villages within the radius, and 3 villages were chosen for inclusion in the sample. Further, village officials listed all households in the village. From the population of these clusters of 3 villages, households were selected proportional to the size of the village, such that 50 households were spread across the 3 villages.

The fertilizer randomization was conducted publicly. The names of all sample households were placed in a bucket and drawn in front of a gathering of said households. The lottery 'losers' were given a $5 airtime voucher, while the 'winners' received 50kg of fertilizer.

Agricultural insurance and contract farming,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/486,"August 24, 2014",2014-08-24 20:54:55 -0400,AEARCTR-0000486,"Jack Willis, jackwillis@fas.harvard.edu",in_development,2014-08-25,2015-08-25,"[""agriculture"", ""finance"", """"]","O13, Q14","Agricultural production entails large risks from crop failure which farmers living at subsistence levels are ill-suited to bear. Attempts to reduce these risks through insurance contracts have typically been unsuccessful due to low take-up rates. In this project, we work with one of the largest private sector contract farming schemes in East Africa, investigating what constrains the take-up rate and testing innovative insurance schemes for contract farming settings. This project will consider the role of inter-temporal distortions in constraining take-up.

The theoretical justification for insurance is as a transfer across states, not across time: the welfare gain arises through shifting consumption from good states, where the marginal utility of consumption is low, to bad states, where it is high. However, standard insurance contracts work by the payment of a premium ex-ante for an ex-post state dependent payout. That is, real world insurance contracts combine state dependent payouts with saving, rather than with other state dependent payouts. Insurance shifts risk from those from whom it is more costly to those for whom it is less costly, but in its standard formulation these welfare improvements are partly offset by shifting saving from those for whom it is likely to be cheap to those for whom it is expensive.

The most likely reason for the standard ex-ante payment is enforcement. An insurance contract which is just a transfer across states with no ex-ante payment is unlikely to be incentive compatible: in the absence of enforceable contracts, as may be the case in many rural agricultural settings, in good states the insured would not pay the insurer. Contract farming offers a potential solution to this, thus allowing insurance to be offered without a transfer across time. Since the farmer and buyer enter a contract (typically enforced on the side of the farmer through the buyer having a monopsony) the buyer can provide inputs on credit to the farmer, with the cost reclaimed with interest from the harvest revenue of the farmer. Currently, the partner company offers several inputs (e.g., land preparation, fertilizer) to farmers in this way, enabling them to solve the challenge of increasing levels of fertilizer use in Kenya. Similarly the buyer can offer insurance with the premium paid on credit (or, equivalently, in the form of a flatter payment schedule).

The proposed research will investigate whether demand for insurance with ex-post premium is higher than traditional insurance and if so, which of the possible mechanisms / inter-temporal distortions are important in constraining demand in this setting. It will do so by randomly offering either ex-post premium or standard insurance to farmers and then observing the difference in take up rate.",2014-08-25,2015-02-28,"Our primary analysis will test the difference in take-up of insurance with upfront payment (at actuariall fair and discounted premium) vs. payment through deduction. 

We will also look at heterogeneity of take-up by each of the following covariates. 

- Rate of intertemporal substitution of income and time inconsistency of this rate.
- Wealth (land ownership, number of cows)
- Index of trust toward the company (index 1-4)
- Percentage difference between subjective expected yield and yield predicted by the model
- Yield of last cycle
- Subjective likelihood that the plot will be in debt at the end of the cycle.

If any of these variables presents a particularly skewed distribution, we will report the heterogeneity by the trimmed variable or by deciles

In addition, if the take-up in the upfront insurance with actuarially fair price and that with discounted premium are similar, we will bundle these two treatments to maximize power on the heterogeneity analysis.","","We study take-up of agricultural insurance in a sample of approximately 600 sugarcane contract farmers. 

Plots are randomized in three treatment groups

With sample size of 200 plots per group (upfront actuarially fair vs. deduction payment vs. upfront discounted), we have a minimum detectable effect of around 10 percentage points. Note that these calculations do not take into account field fixed effects and therefore, as long as field have predictive power, are likely to be conservative

The primary goal of JEEViKA is to promote socio-economic inclusion of impoverished rural households by mobilizing women into self-help groups (SHGs). SHG members meet regularly to participate in savings, borrowing and repayments; additionally, the group provides an opportunity for 10-15 women of similar backgrounds to come together and discuss their day-to-day lives. Each SHG member is required to deposit 10-20 cents in a joint account weekly; once sufficient equity is established, members may begin drawing credit from this pool. After some weeks or months of demonstrated group savings, JEEViKA provides the SHG with a one-time grant of 900 USD, which the SHG may disburse as loans to its members. JEEViKA then links SHGs to banks in order to leverage funds from formal credit institutions. The annual cost of credit to SHG members through the program is 24%, well below rates charged by informal creditors in the study setting. The primary outcomes of the evaluation are households' financial position at endline (value of high-cost debt held; average interest rate on household debt; asset position), and indicators of women's autonomy, decision-making role within the household, and propensity to engage in collective action.

In each of the study panchayats, one to two villages were then randomly selected for inclusion in the study. In each study village, one or more hamlets in which the majority of the populated belonged to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe was identified, and households were randomly selected within these.  Overall, 9000 households were interviewed at baseline in the 180 study panchayats using a structured data collection instrument. In addition, focus group discussions were held in each study village, one to which all community residents were invited, including men and women, and one which was restricted to women in targeted areas of the community (the intended beneficiaries of the intervention). The purpose of these discussions was to understand baseline community characteristics and capabilities.

2. Costs: Different levels of subsidies will create random variation in the number of households applying for power at the same time. By connecting multiple households at the same time, utilities can experience significant economies of scale in transport, design, and low-voltage line costs.

In the pilot experiment, randomization was stratified by four variables: Hindi literacy, baseline work performance, village population, and subcenter. Literacy was directly measured during the baseline survey through an assessment involving asking the ASHAs to read a Hindi sentence. Baseline performance was operationalized as the number of client visits reported by each ASHA during her first 90 days of using CommCare. Because ASHAs received CommCare training in batches, the dates corresponding to the 90-day interval vary by ASHA, and because some were trained as late as October 2012, the interval was limited to 90 days to avoid censoring the performance data of these late trainees. ASHAs are assigned by the government to cover specific villages, and the village population variable is based on data from the 2001 Indian national census, which was the latest publicly available census at the time. Finally, subcenters are the first-level public health facilities in the local health system. They are staffed by auxiliary-nurse midwives (ANMs), and each subcenter takes as its catchment area a designated, contiguous cluster of surrounding villages. ASHAs are linked to subcenters by virtue of the village that they work in, and they are loosely supervised by the ANM in the subcenter.

In the replication experiment, randomization will be stratified by six variables: Hindi literacy (as described above), intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, prosocial motivation, and number of follow-up visits in the previous 4 and 12 months.

Many employers across the United States are implementing or considering employee wellness programs in an effort to control costs while improving employee productivity and health. The Affordable Care Act also established a variety of incentives for employee wellness. Despite the popularity of wellness programs, little rigorous evidence exists on their effects on health, productivity, and health care costs or utilization. Such evidence is crucial for employers and policymakers alike.  

We will evaluate the effect of a year-long employee wellness intervention at a large multi-state firm in the Eastern United States, using a randomized controlled trial design.  The wellness intervention will consist of several components, including team-based wellness challenges, nutrition counseling, stress reduction, and individual-focused physical activity. The intervention has been designed with and will be fielded through an experienced and large-scale vendor. 

Randomizing this intervention across a set of treatment and control sites, we will evaluate its impact on 5 categories of outcomes gathered from both primary and administrative data sources: (1) self-reported health and well-being, (2) biometrics (such as body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar), (3) worker absenteeism and turnover, (4) health care spending and utilization, and (5) return on investment.  Better information about the effectiveness of such programs should inform both employer investment and public policy.

The market for improved sanitation services (mechanized desludging in particular) is important:  sanitation services have high externalities for the local communities. A government may want to intervene in the market for sanitation services but find it difficult to do so as they are unable to observe values for the consumers or costs for the service providers.  We will measure the underlying values of services for customers, measure the cost of providing services for desludging operators, and measure the impact of information on the level of satisfaction of households with their desludging operators and whether they continue to use them on future desludgings.  This information can then be used to help in designing interventions by the government which will improve the market structure of sanitation services.

In Accra, Ghana, a more advanced sanitation service market, we introduce a call center system aimed at improving linkages between desludging providers and customers, and test the impact on desludging prices, customer satisfaction, and desludger business revenue.

Stability of client-provider matches will be measured through reported repeat client-provider matches and likelihood to recommend or use the same provider again.","We begin with a census of desludging operators and owners in Accra to enroll in the call center. At baseline, we will survey 4,500 households. Of these, 3,600 participants will receive the phone number for the call center, and 900 will serve as a control group. An additional sample of approximately 2,000 households in treatment clusters will be given the call center phone number, but will not be surveyed.
","The call center will remain in operation for a period of just over one year. During this time, the call center will collect data related to calls matching clients with desludgers. The clients who call will state their location, and will be connected to the lowest cost available desludger for their neighborhood selected through the moving average auction. The call center will not pre-negotiate or purchase desludgings. It will only connect clients and desludgers, who will then negotiate a price for the service. Two days after being assigned a desludger, the call center will call the client to conduct a follow-up survey about the quality of service provided during the desludging, as well as the price.

","","Subtreatments

Revenue: This incentives treatment group rewards tax circle staff (inspectors, constables, and clerks) on the basis of increases in revenue collection. Each circle is assigned one of three bonus rates i.e. either 40%, 30% or 20%. The differential bonus rate takes into account the differences in the size of circles i.e. to promote equity larger circles, where revenue increases are relatively larger, will be compensated at a lower rate than smaller circles where it is more difficult to raise revenue. The benchmark for each circle is generated using historical collection data for that specific circle and represents expected revenue collection. Each inspector continues to receive his or her current base salary, plus a bonus proportional to the tax revenue he or she collects above the benchmark.

Revenue Plus:

The Revenue Plus treatment is similar to the Revenue treament, but checks against over-aggressive tax collection by factoring in assessment accuracy and taxpayer satisfaction by utilizing an objective third party customer feedback assessment conducted on a randomly selected sample of 50-100 properties in each tax circle. The idea is that in additional to simple increased revenue collection, other components of the tax collection process are important. 

In addition to the bonus pay based on increase in tax revenue collected, tax personnel may also be punished for poor performance in situations such as under- or overtaxing properties (the revenue based honorarium is particularly sensitive to this possibility) and rewarded in cases where they are doing an accurate job. There is ample evidence from the theoretical literature that imposing such penalties and rewards raises performance. Moreover, since an important source of inaccuracy in property assessment is due to misclassification of properties, such customer feedback mechanisms can provide reasonably reliable checks on tax inspector performance.

The customer satisfaction and accuracy adjustment is based on the results of a third party survey conducted in all circles in the scheme. Accuracy is measured as the correlation between true tax liability and official tax liability. Scores for customer satisfaction and tax assessment accuracy are calculated using survey-based questions such as satisfaction with customer service, the degree to which proper procedures were followed, and satisfaction with the outcome in dealing with the tax department. Then these scores are added together to give each circle a total score, which is used to rank circles in this scheme and divide them into three groups (top, middle, and bottom) of approximately equal size. Circle staff get paid as in revenue treatment, but the top group gets an additional bonus equal to 0.75 times their base salary, and the bottom group lose 0.75 times their base salary.

As in the revenue scheme, each inspector continues to receive his or her current base salary, but the proportional bonus is adjusted based on accuracy and customer satisfaction.

Flexible Bonus:

This treatment aims to mimic the way bonuses work the private sector for many complex jobs: managers distribute a fixed bonus pool to talented employees based on all factors they observe. Everyone gets a base salary supplement equal to 1.5 times their salary: each inspector is entitled to an honorarium of Rs. 30,000/month, and each constable and clerk is entitled to an honorarium of Rs. 23,000/month. Each quarter, 50% of this payment will be made unconditionally, so that in Q1-Q3, each inspector will receive Rs. 15,000/month and each constable/clerk will receive Rs. 11,500/month. At the end of the fiscal year, a ""Performance Evaluation Committee"" divides circles in this group into three equal size groups -- top, middle, and bottom -- based on a holistic assessment of performance, including recovery, increase in net demand, customer satisfaction, accuracy, and a subjective ""director's rating"". All circle staff get paid 1.5 times their base salary top-up, but the top group gets an additional bonus equal to 0.75 times their salary, while the bottom group loses 0.75 times their salary (though slightly less in year 2).

agricultural decision making ","","The primary goal of this project is to test whether alleviating constraints facing small holder farmers can increase their production, and ultimately sell their production through commercial channels. Specifically, we test two constraints:
•	Constraint 1 – Information: We hypothesize that many farmers lack knowledge that is keeping them from producing as efficiently as they could. This knowledge could be technical (for example what farming techniques are most effective, what crops are best suited to the farmer’s fields) or managerial (for example how to decide how much to invest in fertilizer, high quality seeds, etc).  
•	Constraint 2 – Capital: We hypothesize that farmers are restricted from making productive investments because they lack capital (and access to affordable credit).","In Malawi, the evaluation will be conducted by comparing results among two cross-cutting randomization interventions. 
The first intervention is the information intervention:
•	Group 1 – Control: This group will receive no new services and their behavior will serve as a comparison.
•	Group 2 – Intensive agriculture extension: Farmers in this group will receive individualized information from experts on how to make their farms more productive. The experts will work with farmers to develop a plan. The exact nature of information provided will be developed with our partners and conditional on the context and the needs of the farmers. Comparison of this group to Group 1 will tell us if alleviation of the information constraint results in improved farmer outcomes.
The second intervention is the provision of capital through different mechanisms to test the most appropriate modality of this production transfer:
•	Group 1 – Control: This group will receive no additional inputs nor any cash and their behavior will serve as a comparison.
•	Group 2 - Cash transfer: Farmers in this group will additionally receive a cash transfer in several installments that is intended to help them carry out the plan developed with the expert. 
•	Group 3 – In-kind transfer: Farmers in this group will additionally receive an in-kind transfer of agricultural inputs that will help them carry out the plan developed with the expert. This in-kind transfer will be of equivalent size to the cash transfer made where inputs are priced at local market prices. 
Given the pilot nature of this study and the size of the study the interaction of the cross-cutting interventions is not of primary importance. Given group level assignment stratification is only possible at this level. We will stratify on district, age of group, and size of group.

In Senegal, the evaluation will be conducted by comparing results across three randomized groups:

But the quality of these services is often lacking, limiting their ultimate impact on the world’s poor. While many factors contribute to service delivery problems, one important factor is governance. The incentives that shape frontline service provider performance, training, oversight, and management all play an important role in the quality of healthcare provided by any health system. Transparency and accountability (T/A) techniques—such as social audits, public expenditure tracking surveys, citizen report cards, absenteeism studies, and community scorecards—are increasingly seen as one potential solution to some of these problems in that they allow communities to identify breakdowns and hold responsible agents or decision makers to account.

Yet the evidence about the effectiveness of these interventions is frustratingly mixed. Some studies of T/A interventions show tremendously positive effects on community empowerment and health and education outcomes, while others show no impact. Further, evidence on successful interventions provides few insights into why these interventions worked, what aspects of the context played a role, and whether they truly empowered poor communities or were largely irrelevant to the deeper problems of power inequity, institutional failure, or social conflict that often foster slow and uneven development. One consequence of this evidence gap is that reformers, policymakers, donors, and other practitioners lack clear guidance on whether any T/A interventions can ultimately empower poor populations and improve service delivery to them and on what sorts of T/A interventions should be pursued in different contexts.

The Transparency for Development (T4D) project is designed to investigate the questions of whether well-designed T/A interventions improve health outcomes and under what conditions. The overriding goal is to generate actionable evidence for practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders working to improve health, accountability, and citizen participation.

The Transparency for Development project will:

1. Design, pilot, and rigorously evaluate a series of T/A interventions across several countries and contexts carefully selected to allow maximum potential for producing generalizable results about whether, where, and why T/A interventions improve development outcomes
2. Develop and widely disseminate the project’s findings along with concrete recommendations for donors, policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders on how to apply the findings to future work in transparency and accountability.

As a result, despite massive increases in access to high school and post-secondary education in the last two decades, there is still tremendous educational inequality in this country. One problem is that although attendance and performance in lower grades is highly predictive of grade repetition and drop out in later grades, parents may not always be aware of this link. Moreover, we have seen in prior work that parents may not always have the correct information about child behaviors in school. This project targets two aspects of parental involvement with the school system: information and skills. We designed an experiment to randomly provide parents with regular information about children’s activities and behavior at school, using text messages.  After some time using this SMS program, we treat a subset of these parents with a complementary investment that informs them how to use these markers (attendance, grades, behavior) to monitor and guide their children towards improved investments in school.

Nudging Good Politicians: How Conditional Incentives Impact Political Selection,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/358,"August 05, 2014",2014-08-05 04:15:45 -0400,AEARCTR-0000358,"Nico Ravanilla, rnico@umich.edu",on_going,2013-08-16,2014-09-30,"[""governance"", """"]","D72, D82, D23","I evaluate a policy intervention that screens-in and selectively incentivizes good politicians.

EDIT 08/05/14:
In October 2013, in the middle of the treatment interventions, Pres.Benigno Aquino III signed the law that postpones the SK ( Youth Council) Elections from October 28, 2013 to a date between October 28, 2014 February 28, 2015 (please see supporting document file, ""Law Postponing SK Elections.pdf"") Along with this law is the Implementing Rules and Regulations (please see supporting document file, ""Implementing Rules of RA10632.pdf"") that details the creation of a Task Force on Youth Development in the interim, when the SK offices are held vacant.

These changes imply that I cannot measure the original outcome of interest until after the new scheduled election date. In the interim (Agust 2014), I will conduct a follow-up survey that will measure the following:
(1) On a scale of 0-10 (10 being most likely), respondent's likelihood of running for youth council post
(2) On a scale of 0-10 (10 being most interested), respondent's interest in joining the Task Force on Youth Development
(3) An indicator variable for whether they got nominated to be part of the Task Force on Youth Development
(4) An indicator variable for whether they actually got designated as member of the Task Force on Youth Development.
And other measures that get at their political participation and interest in public service since they were exposed to the treatment interventions.","","The design of the field experiment is as follows. Before a scheduled election, call for applications will be sent out to citizens who are contemplating on running for an elective office. The call for application is for an all-expense-paid workshop that would equip participants with knowledge and leadership skills useful in campaigning and in policymaking. There will be limited slots and so interested participants will be informed that selection is not guaranteed but that everybody will have an equal chance of being selected.

There will be a pre-workshop session in which selected applicants will be asked to take a baseline survey and undergo a series of tests. The tests, in particular, will measure ""quality"" such as aptitude (measured by a test of memory for digit span), personality trait (measured by Big Five Inventory), motivational profile (measured by Perry's 1996 scale of Public Service Motivation), and aspiration (measured by Kasser and Ryan's 1993 aspiration index). Additionally, I will measure the ratio of the
length of the index and ring fingers (also called the ""digit ratio"") as proxy for biologically determined factors of altruism and prosocial behavior.

After the pre-workshop session, respondents will then be randomly assigned into three experimental groups: a Control Group (A), a Workshop with Conditional Incentive Treatment Group (B), and a Workshop with Unconditional Incentive Treatment Group (C). Participants in the Control Group (A) will not be invited to the workshop and will not receive any further intervention. They will act as the counterfactual, the ""business-as-usual"" group.

Those assigned to the treatment groups B and C, on the other hand, will be invited to attend a workshop. However, none of them will be informed of any incentives at the time of the invitation, to prevent differential take-up across these two treatment arms. In the workshop, participants will attend different sessions in which their output and performance will be monitored and scored. If the screening theory is correct, then ""high quality"" participants (e.g. those who have high aptitude, are more altruistic, or have high public service motivation, etc.) should be delivering quality outputs and performing better than their counterparts.

If a participant is assigned in Treatment Group B (workshop with conditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive at the end of the workshop only if he/she makes the predetermined cutoff score. On the other hand, if he/she is assigned in Treatment Group C (workshop with unconditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive regardless of his/her score. 

The incentive is a certificate of merit to be awarded during the closing ceremony of the workshop, and, should the incentive recipients decide to subsequently run for an elective office, the sponsoring partner organization shall donate 5 pieces of campaign posters to them. In other words, the incentive is designed to lower the cost of campaigning and to increase the psychic benefit of running for office.

I am interested in measuring the effect of the treatments on the composition of those who choose to stand for office. If the screening theory is correct, I only expect treatment group B to work in selectively nudging high quality citizens to run for office, where quality is measured by their baseline characteristics (i.e. memory for digit span, public sector motivation, digit ratio, aspiration, and personality). Because the incentive in treatment group B is only given conditional on making the workshop performance scores cutoff, and because ‘high quality’ respondents are more likely to make the cutoff (given that effort is less costly to them), then the mechanism works to selectively incentivize high quality citizens to run for office. In effect, this causes a higher proportion of high quality citizens running for office in this group relative to the other experimental groups, A and C.

Practical Considerations: A foremost practical concern of my research project is how to identify the population of interest – these aspiring political candidates. It is virtually impossible to find a group of political amateurs who would be willing to participate in a large-N experimental study in which some of them are randomly
assigned into being exposed to a workshop described above. I look to a particular and germane political setting to implement this proposed field experiment my
country, the Philippines. The Philippines is by far the only country in the world that popularly elects youth representatives to its smallest political unit—the barangay (village). Each of the 42,000+ barangays in the country is mandated by law (under the Local Government Code of 1991) to establish a Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a governing body comprised of youth aged 15 to 17 years old. Crucially for my proposed research project, the SK is a low-stakes public office (both in terms of
remuneration and in scope of responsibilities) and it often serves as a jump-off point for a political career for aspiring politicians. Therefore, their group offers an apt opportunity to implement my proposed policy intervention.","Those selected to attend the workshop will be randomly assigned into a workshop batch (since there will be several batches of workshop) and within a batch, randomly assigned into small groups to randomly generate networks among subjects. This is so that one can test whether social networks explain political selection (e.g. a subjects likelihood of standing for office depends on another subject's (within the small group) decision to stand for office.)",Randomization done in office by a computer.,Individual.,570 individuals,570 individuals,"190 individuals control, 190 individuals workshop with conditional incentives, 190 individuals workshop with unconditional incentives

Participation in Regulatory Drafting and Downstream Compliance,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/529,"October 23, 2014",2014-10-23 11:44:57 -0400,AEARCTR-0000529,"Edmund Malesky, ejm5@duke.edu",in_development,2014-10-26,2015-08-31,"[""governance"", ""labor"", """"]",012 015,"Our project aims to assess the current participatory process that exists in Vietnam for draft legislation and regulations, testing whether participation by businesses can improve labor rights and safety.  We use an RCT to analyze the downstream compliance to an important chemical storage regulation of five randomly assigned groups of firms: 1) those simply receiving a presentation about the regulation; 2) those invited to provide comments on the draft regulation; 3) those invited, but also subsequently notified of the response of the responsible regulatory agency to their comments; 4) those not invited, but told about the participation of similar firms; and 5) a control group not invited to participate, but instead receiving a placebo.  After the final regulation is promulgated, the team will monitor the firms in all five groups to test compliance with the final legislation.  Because safety requirements for hazardous chemicals are readily observable, we will have clear evidence of whether participation led to downstream compliance and which of the 3 mechanisms is most responsible.

Many developing countries, including Vietnam, suffer from a challenging combination of a rapidly expanding business sector (especially small and medium sized firms) and limited government capacity to carry out its mandate of regulating the impact of businesses on their surrounding environments, employees, and communities. The consequences of the gap between these two realities are substantial, in terms of both tangible harm to members of society and a reduced legitimacy for government. 

International development organizations invest millions of dollars each year into legislative participation campaigns in an effort to foster improved governance.  Political scientists in the Deliberative Democracy literature, in particular, argue that participation in the drafting of new rules, through public comment periods, provides information about citizens’ needs and preferences to government. Governments can then use this information, they argue, to make laws and regulations that will enjoy wider societal compliance.  Relatedly, studies in psychology and organizational behavior indicate that individuals are more likely to follow rules they have had the opportunity to influence.  We propose that a similar dynamic between participation and compliance applies among businesses as well.

Testing this hypothesis in a developing country context constitutes a critical contribution to research on how participation affects policy outcomes because of the uniquely powerful influence firms have over workers and the environment. Recent newspapers headlines have documented the substantial harm caused by firms not complying with government labor, safety, and environmental regulations.  In preparation for our project, Vietnam’s Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLISA) calculated that less than 10% of firms are currently in compliance with rules on worker safety, with the frequency of violations particularly large among smaller, more informal operations. Because of the limited capacity of many developing countries, greater enforcement does not seem to be a viable option; encouraging self-compliance is truly the best hope. 

There are important policy implications to be drawn from better understanding of the precise mechanisms by which firm participation in rule making influence subsequent compliance. Three underlying mechanisms have been proposed by Deliberative Democracy theorists: 1) firms have a better understanding of regulations and so are less likely to make mistakes; 2) firms view the legislative process and governing institutions as more legitimate after participation; 3) the resulting legislation is of higher quality and better tailored to local preferences, thereby reducing conflict between firms and the state. These ideas have had real influence in developing countries, including our setting of Vietnam, where extensive new participation measures—such as online commenting on draft laws—have been introduced in recent years.
",2014-10-31,2015-01-31,"Compliance Measure 1: Calls to VCCI Regulatory Hotline. During the pre-treatment survey, all firms will be provided with a credit card-shaped thumb drive (USB – see images of product and planned content below) that has VCCI’s seal on the cover. The thumb drive cover will also advertise a toll-free hotline that businesses can call if they have questions about adjustments that need to be made to be considered in compliance with all new sanitary, environment, and labor safety regulations. The VCCI has agreed to host the hotline and MOLISA has agreed to provide chemical experts who can answer any detailed questions of businesses.  As an initial measure of interest in compliance, we will record whether firms called the hotline for assistance, which will provide an initial intention to treat effect.

Compliance Measure 2: Self-Reported Compliance. 45 days after the posting of the final regulation by MOLISA and acceptance by the Vietnamese National Assembly, our teams will return to visit all business to conduct a brief post-treatment survey (June 2015).  During this 15-minute survey, firms will be asked about 3 specific requirements of the Draft Regulation on Handling and Storage of Hazardous Chemicals: 1) equipment, including gloves, masks, and safety showers; 2) storage, including proper containers and designated safety labels; 3) factory organization, including placement of storage facilities and ventilation. Firms will be asked to answer yes or no questions about whether their current processes in these 3 areas are in compliance with Final Regulation on Handling and Storage of Hazardous Chemicals.

Compliance Measure 3: Observed Compliance. After the post-treatment survey at the firm’s factory location, firms will be asked to show the enumerator evidence of their compliance with the final regulation in the 3 highlighted areas (equipment, storage, and factory outlay). Assessments will only be taken of firms that volunteer to show enumerator their facilities and on particularly easy requirements. A key part of our search for the appropriate regulation has been that they include such easy to observe components and–while it is not possible to specifically identify these components until the draft regulation for public commentary is complete–MOLISA chemical experts have strongly recommended the three areas highlighted above are particularly feasible. Times will differ by factories, but we estimate observing compliance should take a maximum of twenty minutes.  Only if firms agree, photographs of chemical equipment, storage, and outlay will be taken and stored with the dataset. Like the dataset, these photographs will be only identified with a firm id generated by the PIs that is only available to the PIs. The connection between firm identifying information and firm id is also only available to PIs. Further, we do not plan to publish these photographs in any publication or presentation relating to this research. Express consent would need to be sought for any such actions.

Summary of Stage 3: A hotline number for complying with regulations will be provided to firms during the pre-treatment survey in September 2014 and will be live immediately. Self-reported compliance will be measured in a post-treatments survey administered to all 1800 firms that will take about 15 minutes. Direct observations of compliance will take place immediately after the post-treatment survey. Observations of compliance will be voluntary and will not take longer than 20 minutes. This is simply an assessment of enumerators and it will be made very clear that this is not a formal inspection.

It is impossible to measure whether participation improved the quality of the law and therefore stimulated compliance through experimental design. The problem is that, unless firm-level preferences are highly variegated, it is unlikely that control and treatment groups will differ dramatically in their preferences over the regulation. Consequently, if the treatment groups’ ideas significantly improve the quality and acceptability of the laws, control firms are as likely to change their behavior as treatment firms. We would observe no difference between the compliance of the different groups statistically. In short, a highly successful experiment would appear as a non-result. 

Q1 (Quality of Regulation): To ensure that we capture this potential effect, we have designated a fifth group of 100 firms as “judges” of legal quality. These firms will also be randomly sampled from the population at the beginning of the experiment, and will match the other groups on all observable characteristics. Rather than being subject to an experimental manipulation, these firms will simply be given untitled and unmarked versions of the draft regulation and final regulation resulting from the controlled experiment during June 2014. Their primary task will be to identify which of these blind documents they think is the superior legislation.  The selection should not take longer than 10 minutes.

Q2 (Watered Down Regulation): To ensure that high quality law does not simply mean “watered down” regulations, we are also preparing to engage in an equivalent exercise with a group of 30 labor safety experts and knowledgeable workers. This group will also be asked to assess whether the final regulation is better than the draft in terms of its protections for workers. The selection should not take longer than 10 minutes.

MOLISA has yet to complete its pre-regulation study, so the numbers they gave us our ballpark estimates.  According to their current inspection records, only 8% of affected firms are complying with the existing regulations.  MOLISA did not have a population size of affected firms, but did provide us with a list of the industrial sectors that would be covered by the new chemical storage regulation, including a wide range of industries from chemical producers to paint manufacturers to garment companies.  Using this list, we matched these sectors to the list of registered firms in the Hanoi metropolitan area from the National Tax Authority database.  This matching exercise produced 5,200 operations that would be affected by new chemical storage guidelines.   The Tax Authority list also includes information on size (annual revenue), four digit ISIC code, and gender of the business owner/manager.   This sample frame is preliminary, because the sectors of affected firms may shift after the final pre-regulation study is completed.

Key Assumptions: 
1. Current compliance rates are extremely low (8%), implying that variation in compliance is also quite low and the expected effect size of each additional treatment will be reasonably large (after all, we are measuring growth from a near zero level).  

2. To keep the power calculations tractable, we conceptualize the empirical analysis as three separate tests:  H1 (Information) = T1>C; H2 (Participation)= T2>T1; H3 (Legitimacy)= T3>T2.  

3. We calculate our estimated treatment effects based on two sources: 1) theoretical literature on the participation-compliance relationship; and 2) observational data from the Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index survey on current levels of compliance with labor laws.  From these, we expect the effect size for T1 to be about .22 standard deviations (or a 6 percentage point change in the level of compliance).  Conservatively, we estimate the effect size of participation (T2) to be about the same (6 points).  Based on the theoretical literature, we estimate the effect size of legitimacy to be twice that of information alone (.44 standard deviations or 12 percentage points). 

4. Further, using observational data from we estimate that explained variation from our three blocking variables (size, narrow sector, and gender) to be about 10%.
Calculation: Using the Optimal Design software to measure effects with 5% statistical significance and with 80% power, we calculate that we would need about 522 observations in the sample.  To account for potential non-response and to provide some cushion, we conservatively estimate 600 observations for both the control group and T1 (See Figure 1).  Repeating this exercise for the T2, we employ the same estimated treatment effect, requiring 300 additional observations (we used 400).  For H3, the legitimacy treatment, the larger effect size means that we require only 133 observations to reach 80% power (See Figure 2).  To be conservative, maintain simplicity, and to allow room for a study of heterogeneous effects with the blocking variables, we maintained the same 600 observations as

The prevalence of clientelism, ethnic voting and faulty elections are commonly held as the main culprits. Our research project focuses instead on two alternative barriers that weaken democratic accountability across Africa: (1) acute lack of politician performance information in the hands of citizens, which renders citizens ethnic or clientelistic voters; and (2) lack of information in the hands of politicians about service deficiencies in their constituency, which reduces their ability to monitor and sanction service providers. In collaboration with a leading Ugandan NGO – Advocates Coalition for Democracy and the Environment (ACODE) – IPA associated Principal Investigators Guy Grossman and Kristin Michelitch have designed two interventions to directly address these informational barriers: (1) a widespread dissemination of information regarding the performance of local government councilors' to citizens, and (2) opening a new channel of communication from citizens to local government councilors to report public service deficiencies via an innovative text message technology. 

Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) method, the research team is studying the extent to which those two interventions impact the behavior of voters and politicians, and ultimately the provision of public services, such as health and education. Our research design involves a panel survey of citizens, local councilors, and public service providers, pre and post-intervention implementation. This study has clear theoretical and policy implications. Theoretically, it will contribute to the growing micro-foundational body of work on political accountability in low-income countries with weak democratic institutions. Specifically it brings together and improves upon the largely disjointed literatures on political accountability and public service provision. From a policy perspective, the project will generate useful knowledge about the effectiveness of new innovations to improve the provision of education and health services to marginalized populations. More so, this study breaks new ground in the utilization of recent information technology innovations to affect politicians-constituents relations.

More broadly, the evidence indicates that SMS messages can change behaviour when aimed at short-term behavioural outcomes (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009). However, the UK Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) has found that the content of the message is also very important. 

Early trials have found that adding a person’s name to the a text message increases the likelihood that someone will pay a court fine (Behavioural Insights Team, 2012) and more recent trials have found that emphasizing the costs to the healthcare system can increase attendance rates (Hallsworth et al., in submission). Similarly, personable and personal messages increased attendance substantially (Kirkman et al., in submission). The trials run by the Behavioural Insights Team have also found that bland and impersonal text messages can have no impact on attendance whatsoever. 

Text messages are currently used in some New South Wales (NSW) hospitals to encourage people to attend their outpatient appointments. However, these messages are not sent out as routine practice. 

In this trial, a NSW hospital will trial the whether 8 text messages will increase the likelihood of people attending their outpatient appointments.  Testing various text messages will allow us to further the science on persuasive messages and lead to cost savings for the hospital.

The content of these messages shall focus on: lost revenue to the hospital, lost revenue to other patients, revenue gains to the hospital, revenue gains to patients, aggregated losses to the hospital, a notice that people are free not to attend but they should cancel in advance or that their failure to turn up shall be recorded.

These messages were chosen as they are based on prior work, namely Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), meta analyses into the use of the phrase ""But you are free"" (Carpenter, 2013)  and some unpublished work by the Behavioural Insights Team. These phrases all have theoretical underpinnings, but this study shall test whether or not these theoretical underpinnings translate into an applied policy setting.

Prior to the start of the trial the hospital's previous 6 months of data (n=27488) were analysed to understand whether or not the messages that people would have received was associated with their likelihood to turn up to their appointment. A simple chi squared test indicated that there was no significant impact [x2(7)=10.3, p=.175].  Similarly, when 7 logistic regression models were run to test whether or not any groups would have performed better than the control group no significant differences were found.

To test whether or not the message received has had an impact on attendance, a chi squared text shall be used with 7 degrees of freedom. This will be able to find a very small effect (w>0.52). 

If this test is significant, 7 logistic regression shall be used. This method shall be used instead of a bonferroni correction, which is deemed too conservative. This shall test whether or not any of the message variants perform better than the control message. These tests will each include roughly 2000 observations (1000 from treatment variant n and 1000 from the control) and will be able to find an odds ratio of 1.24, based on analysis from g*power with alpha=0.05 and beta= 0.05. If beta is increased to 0.2, then the study will be powered to find an odds ratio of 1.17. These effect sizes are smaller than the minimum effect size of interest.

Before they can provide hormonal contraceptives to clients, CHWs use a pregnancy checklist, a series of questions that allows CHWs to assess whether a woman is pregnant. However, CHWs may not trust the checklist and it categorizes many non-pregnant women as pregnant. This study assesses the impact of offering free pregnancy test kits to CHWs on the number of clients that they supply hormonal contraceptives to. Using a randomized-controlled design, we randomly assigned CHWs in three regions in Madagascar to either receive pregnancy tests kits (treatment) or not (control). This intervention increased the number of new hormonal contraceptive clients per CHW by 0.6 clients per month, representing a 23% increase.

We also separate this result into the number of new oral contraceptive clients and new injectable clients, which together make up the total number of new hormonal contraceptive clients. New hormonal contraceptive clients are hormonal contraceptive clients who either: (1) have never previously obtained contraceptives from the CHW; or (2) had previously obtained hormonal contraceptives from the CHW but had stopped for a period, and have now obtained a new prescription.

These responses will be further classified as ""positive response"" (any call or email suggesting potential interest) or ""interview"" (specifically requests interview). The main outcome of interest will be ""positive responses.""","",Will be made public when the trial is complete,"This study investigates the labor market effects of Ban the Box legislation, which prohibits employers from asking about criminal records on job applications.  The design is a correspondence audit study focusing on entry-level employers in New Jersey, which adopted a Ban-the-Box law effective March 1, 2015.  Fictitious online job applications will be sent to these entry-level employers both before the law goes into effect (the pre-period) and after the law goes into effect (the post-period). 
We are investigating several questions:
(1) What is the effect of stating (on an online job application) that one has a criminal record on the probability that employers will give an applicant a positive response?  This question will be principally tested using our pre-period data.  (After Ban-the-Box goes into effect, most employers will presumably remove the criminal records question.  Some employers do not have the question even in the pre-period.)
(2) Does this effect vary depending on the applicant's other characteristics?  The primary interaction effect of interest is race x record.  We will also test interactions with characteristics that may signify incarceration: GED (vs high school diploma) and employment gaps, and we will test whether race interacts with these other characteristics.
(3) What is the main effect of other applicant characteristics on positive response probability?  Again, we will assess race (the effect of primary interest), education type, and employment gap effects, using both pre- and post-period data.
(4) Do employers in fact comply with Ban-the-Box by removing the criminal records question?  (This is a purely observational question--it is not subject to experimental manipulation.)
(5) After Ban-the-Box goes into effect, do employers (and particularly those employers that asked about criminal records in the pre-period) become more likely to discriminate based on characteristics that (in the real world) are correlated with criminal records, in particular race, GED (vs. high school diploma), and employment gap? 
 (6) Before Ban-the-Box, is there cross-sectional variation in the effect of these characteristics (race, GED, work gap) between businesses that ask about criminal records on the application and those that do not?

Questions (5) and (6) speak to the same basic question: whether limited access to criminal record information makes employers more likely to statistically discriminate against groups that they perceive as likely to have records.  In order to test that question, we will look both at the two-way interactions described in (5) and (6), and assuming we are able to build a sample that provides sufficient statistical power, at three-way interactions that exploit both cross-sectional and temporal variation (e.g., race*period*box).

Our focus is New Jersey, but other states may be added if they adopt Ban-the-Box while we are working on the study. We will send (fictitious) online job applications to businesses who have posted availability for jobs that are suitable for candidates with limited work experience, no post-secondary education, and no specialized skills.  If there are open jobs in both the pre- and post-period, each business will receive four applications total, one pair in each period. The applications will be similar on all but our randomly assigned treatment dimensions. Those dimensions are:

(1) Has felony criminal conviction or not
  (1a) Conditional on being convicted of a crime: drug conviction or theft conviction
(2) Race: Black or White
(3) Has 1-year employment gap or not
(4) GED or High School Diploma

Characteristics will be independently randomly assigned to a job applicant with equal (50%) probability.  Race is indicated via the name of the applicant – with distinctly black and distinctly white names chosen based on a study of birth certificate records from New Jersey.

All other job applicant characteristics are assigned to be as similar as possible, but randomly varied slightly so as to disguise the similarity of the applications. These include:
(1)	Work history: All job applicants have approximately 3.5 years of work experience - approximately 2 years as a crew member at a fast food chain or convenience store and approximately 1.5 years in a manual labor job such as home improvement, landscaping, or moving.  All applicants are unemployed at the time of the job application, having ended their most recent job 2-3 months before the application is sent. Descriptions of job duties and reasons for leaving jobs were slightly varied.
(2)	Address:  Because it is likely that employers will be concerned about employees being able to get to work, we want applicants to live near the jobs to which they apply. To achieve this, we chose 40 cities/towns in NJ that are nearest to the most open jobs on snagajob.com using an optimization tool included in ArcGIS software.  These 40 town/cities serve as “centers” where our applicants will have address and local phone numbers. Within these centers, 4 addresses are chosen from neighborhoods that are at least 10% black, at least 20% white, and do not have a median income above $100,000.  Addresses are then slightly perturbed so as not to represent real addresses. These addresses are then randomly assigned to applicants.
(3)	High school (if Diploma earner): High schools were chosen to be in cities that are at least 10% black, at least 20% white, have at least 25,000 people, and do not have median income above $100,000.  In addition, the high schools do not have test scores above the 90th or below the 10th percentile.  Then applicants in a center were randomly assigned from this set of high schools that are at least 30 miles from the center (but within New Jersey), to reduce the probability that the high school can send any unobservable signals to the employer.  Applicants with GEDs were randomly assigned descriptions/names of GED training programs. 
(4)	References:  Two fictitious references with phone numbers were created, representing the applicant's supervisors for each previous job.
(5)	Phone number:  Each applicant will be assigned a phone number (purchased from callfire.com) based on their center, race, criminal history, and time period (that is each, each center has 4 potential phone numbers during each time period); the result of this division is that no business will ever receive two applications using the same phone number.  The wording and voice on the outgoing voicemail message was randomized.
(6)	Email address: A unique email address will be created for each applicant, with the format randomly varied.

We then randomly create applicant profiles for each center via the Resume Randomizer program created by Lahey and Beasley (2009). An applicant profile consists of: a name, a phone number (assigned at the center x race x crime level), an address, an employment history, a unique email address, 2 references with phone numbers, information on high school diploma or GED receipt, a criminal history status and information about the criminal charge, and a formatted resume (for use if application requires resume only).

Finding Jobs:
We will use two strategies to identify job openings for which our applicants appear qualified:
(1) snagajob.com  A large online job board dedicated to hourly employment
(2) Job applications sent directly to job openings listed on the websites of chain businesses with at least 30 locations and 300 employees in NJ, per the BusinessUSA database. Industries include restaurants, convenience stores, department stores, home centers, grocery and convenience stores, pharmacies, miscellaneous retail, service stations, and hotels/motels.

Applying for the job:
Each RA will be randomly assigned a ""center"" in which to search for jobs via the above-described methods. Once a job is identified, a profile is randomly chosen from that center to apply for the job.  The RA will then use the information contained in the profile to fill out the job application.  

For each job vacancy up to two job applications will be sent in each time period. In the case that two applications are sent, we use the resume randomizer program to ensure that the second application to the same business doesn’t use the same race (and thus name and phone number), address, or criminal conviction type.  The time between first and second job applications will vary.

It is possible that multiple locations of the same chain business could use the same hiring managers. To avoid allowing these managers to view extremely similar applicants from the same towns and thus arousing potential suspicion, whenever an RA applies to the same company within a geographic center, he/she will always use the same pair of applicant profiles. This mirrors real-world applicant behavior (applying to multiple nearby locations at once is common).   Applications to locations in different centers, in contrast, will differ.  Applications from different centers are less similar to one another (different cities of residence, most recent employers, high schools, etc.), so even if a manager covers locations in multiple centers, this is less likely to trigger suspicion.

Application record-keeping:
While filing the job application, the RA will also fill out a spreadsheet that indicates, among other things, which profile was sent to the job, the date and time of the job application, the name of the company being applied to, the name of the position, address/location of the job, when the job was posted (if available), whether the application asked about criminal history.

Outcome data collection:
We will record whether the applicant receives a call or email from the employer.  Responses will be further classified as ""positive response"" (any contact suggesting interest) or ""interview"" (specifically requests interview). The main outcome of interest will be ""positive response.""  Data will be collected for 8 weeks from the application date.  Note that we are registering this study after ",Randomization performed via computer,"Individual applicant level.  Note that some individual applicants' applications were sent to multiple businesses (within the same chain and geographic center), as described above, so the number of unique applicants is lower than the number of applications.","Approximately 2000 unique applicants.

Note: While randomization was at the applicant level, standard errors may be clustered at a different level, e.g.:
--approximately 1500 businesses, each of which receives up to 4 applications
--approximately 125 corporate chains * 40 geographic regions = 500 clusters (grouping nearby locations of the same chains, to which we are sending the same sets of applications)","Approximately 4,000 to 8,000 applications (best estimate is 6,000)","For each experimentally manipulated attribute, 50% of the sample will have one attribute and 50% the other. This will lead to:

Approximately 1,000 to 2,000 black pre-period
Approximately 1,000 to 2,000 black post-period
Approximately 1,000 to 2,000 white pre-period
Approximately 1,000 to 2,000 white post-period

Same division for other characteristics of interest (GED/HS Diploma, employment gap/no employment gap, criminal record/no criminal record) which will also be split 50/50 in both the pre- and post-periods.  The criminal record arm will further be split into drug crimes/property crimes.

Note that we are interested in the interactions of these characteristics with whether (in the pre-period) the employer asks about criminal records on the initial employment application.  This feature is determined by the research subjects, however, and is not experimentally manipulated.","Of course, final power calculations will depend on the exact feasible sample size (which will be based on how many eligible jobs openings we can identify and constrained by timing considerations due to the law change) and the baseline probability of a call-back in our sample.

In previous audit studies, positive response call-backs have varied widely. Some examples include:
Lahey (2008): 8-10%
Oreopolous (2011): 11-16%
Deming et al (2014): 8.2%
Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004): 8%
Phillips (2015): 18.7%
Pager (2004): ~17%  (in person applications)
Pager et al (2009): 23% (in person applications)

The first 4 audit studies use resumes and mostly college level jobs. The final 3 are more focused on the low-wage, low-skilled sector - Phillips uses both resumes and online applications, Pager and Pager et al use in person job applications. 

In a linear model, if we assume a call-back probability of 15% (conservative based on the studies most closely related to ours), a standard deviation of 0.125 (.15*(1-.15)), power=.8 and alpha=0.05 then our minimum detectable effect size for the main effects of our manipulated characteristics (of, e.g., race) is 0.9 percentage points or 6 percent. 

As our outcome variable is binary, however, using the same call-back probability of 15% and sample size of 6000, making some simplifying assumptions, ignoring clustering,  and using the calculation described in Demidenko E. (2007), we should have the power to detect a main effect (of, e.g., race) with an odds ratio of 1.217, in a simple bivariate logit regression.  See http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eugened/power-samplesize.php. 

In analyses that include interaction effects, power will be reduced.  On the other hand, we also intend to conduct ""within-subjects"" analyses for the businesses that we are able to send applications to in both periods; these analyses should be able obtain greater power with a smaller sample size, although they will be limited only to a subset of the sample.

hysteroscopic-guided pertubal bupivacaine infusion (0.25%) for treating endometriosisassociated
pelvic pain.
Methods: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial, 76 women with
pelvic endometriosis suffering from chronic pelvic pain (CPP) for more than 6 months
and defined as a pain score > VAS 50mm (visual analogue score) were enrolled.
Eligible patients had laparoscopically confirmed pelvic endometriosis (stage I-IV) and
patent fallopian tubes. Sixty CPP patients were randomly assigned to receive either
hysteroscopic-guided pertubal diluted bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion at a single
preovulatory outpatient setting (group I, n=30) or placebo (group II, n=30). Pelvic pain
scores, visual analogue scores and monthly visual rating scales (VRSmonthly) were
assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 months after joining the protocol. At the end of
the study, women completed a questionnaire designed to evaluate the overall patient
satisfaction rate about the procedure
Results: All patients were available for analysis. After identification, the baseline clinical
characteristics for both groups were comparable. There were statistically significant
improvements from corresponding baseline scores at 1, 2, and 3 months for the VAS,
the VRSmonthly, and the pelvic pain scores in the bupivacaine treated group
compared with placebo (P<.05). Along the 3-months duration of the study, all domains
were demonstrated to be substantially lower than the baseline data. At the end of the
study, women in the bupivacaine group expressed a higher degree of patient
satisfaction that was independent of age, duration or severity of the symptoms (73% vs
7%; P<.05). The procedure was well-tolerated by all patients without any adverse
effects.
Conclusions: Office pertubal hysteroscopic-guided bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion has a
place in the management of women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. It offers
a minimally invasive and more cost-effective alternative to current treatments for at
least 3 months.
",2010-06-15,2013-07-30,"For the month preceding the trial, each patient completed a diary for generation of baseline variables, which were used for the assessment of the response to treatment. Response to treatment was assessed subjectively by changes in the variables, which included the patient's perception of pelvic pain severity using a visual analogue scale (VAS), her rating of both types of pelvic pain (dysmenorrheal and/or non-cycling pain) on a daily verbal rating scale (VRS), and a monthly verbal pelvic pain score (VRSmonthly). Satisfaction rates were also assessed. 
Measurement tool:
The VAS was a subjective assessment of the pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain). It was recorded on a 10cm ruler in the diary at each follow-up visit and reflected the severity of this symptom as perceived by the patient in the preceding month (daily VAS). A monthly score (VRSmonthly) was then generated from the summation of daily VAS over a 28-day period (0, no pain; 100, maximum pain) at 1, 2, and 3 months.
 On a multiple-choice questionnaire, an overall patient satisfaction rate that was independent of age, duration or severity of the symptoms was used to assess performance and satisfaction (satisfied, uncertain, dissatisfied) in daily activities at the end of the study taking into account the undesirable side effects. ","","Patient population:
	This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot study was conducted between June 2010 and July 2013. The protocol was approved by local ethics committee of the institution. Each subject signed an informed consent to participate in this trial.
	 During this period, 76 women complaining of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) for > 6 months and defined as a pain score > VAS 50mm (visual analogue scale) were enrolled. Eligible patients had laparoscopically confirmed pelvic endometriosis (stage I-IV) and patent fallopian tubes. The exclusion criteria were age <18 years, any hormonal therapy in preceding 3 months, a desire to conceive within 1 year, or occluded fallopian tubes with or without pelvic adhesions. Cases with proved non-gynecologic causes of CPP (intestinal, urinary, and/or musculoskletal) were also excluded from the study. Each patient was advised to stop any analgesic medications before enrollment into the study. Patients with a known hypersensitivity or any contraindications to bupivacaine or to any local anesthetic agent of the amide-type were also excluded from the study.
	 All women in this trial underwent complete pelvic examination and high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography. Basic work-up investigations to exclude concomitant non-gynecologic causes of CPP including mid-stream urine analysis, stool analysis, intravenous urogram, and full blood count whenever indicated were done. Only subjects with purely diagnosed pelvic endometriosis and patent fallopian tubes were included in this study.
Randomization:
	At the time of office recruitment, patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 that was performed in accordance with a computer-generated randomization sequence using numbered, sealed envelopes to have either pertubal hysteroscopic-guided diluted bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion [Single-dose vial 10 ml + 100 ml Ringer solution] (group I, n=30) or placebo infusion [100 ml Ringer solution alone] (group II, n=30). All patients and experimenters (while delivering treatment, scanning and analyzing data) were blinded to the type of treatment.
	The allocated study solution was provided to the surgeon intraoperatively by senior nursing staff. Solutions were indistinguishable and were preloaded into identical unlabeled Ringer solution bottles. 
Pertubal infusion method:
	The procedure was carried-out in a day-case endoscopic suite. One treatment setting was to be given preovulatory on cycle Day 7-12. Under paracervical block, and using Ringer solution as a uterine distending medium (Hysteromat, Karl Storz, Germany), an office hysteroscope (2.7 mm, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was passed and one tubal orifice was identified. Under a hysteroscopic guidance, a 3-Fr ureteric catheter was introduced, cannulated through the tubal ostium and passed proximally for 2-3 cm. After successful cannulation, diluted bupivacaine (0.25%, 10 ml with Ringer solution 100 ml) [Marcaine, AstraZenica, Istanbul, Turkey] was then infused through the catheter over a 15-20 min period. None of the patients used any adjunctive measures or analgesics following the original treatment. 
Follow-up:
Follow-up visits after hysteroscopic pertubal infusion were scheduled after 1, 2, and 3 months. A month before each visit, the patients completed a diary of their pain score. These were collected at the follow-up visit and new diaries given for the next visit. Grading of symptoms and physical findings were assessed at each clinic visit. The duration of treatment was completed in 3 months. Each patient was advised to stop any analgesic medications and to use barrier contraception throughout the study.","","Randomization:

Evaluating the Effect of the Primary Literacy Project on Literacy and Academic Achievement,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/21,"January 16, 2015",2015-01-16 17:56:41 -0500,AEARCTR-0000021,"Jason Kerwin, jtkerwin@umich.edu",on_going,2013-02-04,2017-12-02,"[""education"", """"]","","Despite ongoing efforts from both the Government of Uganda and the international donor community, many children in Uganda still are not acquiring literacy skills at a satisfactory level. This project evaluates an innovative new educational paradigm, the Primary Literacy Project (PLP), which currently focuses on P1 to P3 (first- to third-grade) students, employing a mother-tongue-first instructional approach and extensive teacher support and training. Using a randomized controlled trial this study measures the effects of the PLP on learning outcomes. We study 128 schools, which were randomly assigned to either the full PLP, a half-program that includes the materials from the PLP but where the training is provided through government-employed coordinating centre tutors (CCTs), or a control group. Outcomes are to be measured principally in terms of improvements in Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Writing Assessment (EGWA) scores. The results of this study will be used to further improve the PLP, helping to maximize both its academic benefits and cost-effectiveness; we also conduct classroom observations (using rubrics and/or videos), surveys of teachers and surveys of parents in order to capture additional outcomes.

This revision to the trial registration updates the study to account for a substantial expansion in its length and scope. The original study followed 38 schools for one year, 2013, focusing solely on P1. In the expanded study, we follow 128 schools (including the first 38) for up to five years, 2013 to 2017, following students from P1 all the way up to P3. We have an additional sample of 30 pure control schools originally sampled that we plan on collecting outcomes near the end of the study.",2013-02-04,2016-12-02,"Test scores, attendance, classroom observations, teacher/parent/child attitudes and behavior toward schooling, administrative records from schools (enrollment, marks, attendance)","","Our experiment is an impact evaluation that randomly assigns schools to either receive the complete PLP intervention, partial PLP intervention or to receive the current standard educational serves, serving as a control.

A.	Site and School Selection 
Eligible schools will include primary schools from the Lango Sub-region. There are two sets of schools in the study, with slightly different selection criteria – Phase 1 schools and Phase 2 schools. Phase 1 schools were selected in late 2012 for participation in an initial phase of the RCT during the 2013 school year. Phase 2 schools were selected in late 2013 for participation in an expanded phase of the RCT from 2014 to 2016. The Phase 1 schools will also remain in the study through 2016.

•	The Phase 1 schools had to meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study:
•	Must be in Aculbanya, Adel, Adyel, Ayer, or Loro coordinating centre (CC)
•	At least two P1 classes
•	An early primary (P1 to P3) student-to-teacher ratio of 135 or less during the 2012 school year
•	P1 classes must have desks
•	15 km or less from the CC
•	A head teacher regarded as “engaged” by the CCT
•	School must be accessible by road including during the rainy season
•	Must not currently or previously be involved in Mango Tree’s project activities

There were 36 schools that met these criteria. This number was later expanded to 38: two schools were dropped and four more were added by relaxing the distance criterion to 20 km instead of 15.

•	The Phase 2 schools had to meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study:
•	Must be in the Lango Sub-region
•	Must have desks in P1, P2 and P3 classrooms
•	Must have blackboards in P1, P2 and P3 classrooms
•	Must have 150 or fewer students per class in each of P1, P2 and P3 classrooms in the 2013 school year

There were 120 schools that met these criteria. Of these, 90 were selected (using stratified random selection) to participate in the study. 30 were selected to remain pure control schools for later evaluation of Hawthorne effects, or effects of the resources provided to the CCTs.

B.	Randomization - Treatment and Control Schools and Classrooms
42 of the 128 schools are randomly assigned as controls, 44 schools as CCT treatment and another 42 schools assigned to the MT treatment. Beyond the data used to select the schools, additional school data – available from district education officers – including location in the Lango sub-region, average performance on previous national exams, the share of female students, and total P1 students, was used for stratified assignment of the treatment.

The random assignment of the treatment was stratified across the 128 target schools in order to ensure a similar distribution of school characteristics across the experimental arms. The 128 schools were divided into stratification groups that were as similar as possible; these sets of 3 schools are known as “stratification groups”. These groups were formed by matching schools on a list of school-level factors. 
•	For the Phase 1 schools, the stratification groups were formed by matching schools on CC, total P1 enrollment, and distance to the coordinating center (CC). 
•	For the Phase 2 schools, the stratification groups were formed by matching schools on CC, then on whether they had more than one P1 stream, then on whether they had smaller-than-median class sizes (less than 94.33 students/class from P1 to P3), then on whether they had a higher-than-median PLE pass rate (more than 4.47%), and then on whether they were closer than the median school to the CC (less than 9 km away).  
Within each stratification group, treatment status was assigned at random at a public meeting of school officials - during December 2012 for the Phase 1 schools and during January 2014 for the Phase 2 schools. For every stratification group three colored tokens, one representing each study arm, were placed into an opaque bag and withdrawn one at a time by a neutral party in full view of all stakeholders. Different color tokens were used to represent the MT treatment, the CCT treatment, and the control group. The three schools were assigned to a specific order, with the first token drawn corresponding to the first school and so forth. Therefore the first token withdrawn determined the study arm assignment of the first school, the second token determined the assignment of the second school, and the third and final remaining token determined the assignment for the third school. This process yielded assignments of schools to study arms. 

The schools randomly assigned to the MT treatment group receive the full LLP intervention, comprising materials, instructional videos, training by Mango Tree’s expert trainers, and classroom support supervision along with continuous professional development by expert trainers. The classrooms in the CCT treatment schools will receive the teaching and learning materials, including instructional videos. Their teachers will be trained and supported by the CCTs as part of their routine teacher training and support supervision duties. Beginning with the 2014 school year, the control schools also receive a set of wall charts covering topics unrelated to our main outcomes, as a gift to thank them for their participation in the study; we can evaluate any effects of these charts using the 30 pure control schools mentioned above.

For all classrooms, we will conduct both baseline and endline exams using the standardized EGRA and EGWA examinations as a measure of literacy competency. The table below shows the components of the LLP received by each study arm as well as the data to be collected from each arm. Wall clocks and slates were randomly allocated among schools in the CCT treatment and control arms. Among these, 20 received slates only, 23 received clocks only, 20 received both, and 23 received none. The control schools are affected both by the CCT training conducted by Mango Tree, and also by the data collection activities themselves. The set of 30 “pure” control schools will help us measure these potential effects.

In addition to the school-level randomizations of variants of the program and of materials, we will also randomize the provision, type, and content of report cards at the individual household level. The NULP provides report cards that are quite different from the typical report cards given out by Uganda’s Ministry of Education and Sports. We will randomize whether households in all three study arms receive regular report cards or NULP-style report cards, and also cross-randomize whether the report cards provide additional information on the returns to schooling. 


C.	Selection and Assignment of Teachers
•	For the Phase 1 schools, the LLP intervention involved asking the head teacher for the school to choose the two best early primary teachers in the school and assign them to the two P1 classrooms. Typically these are the highest skilled teachers in the school who are in good health and are very committed to their work. In order to make each evaluation group equivalent, this was done in each of the 38 study schools for 2013. Head teachers agreed to assign the two best teachers to P1 classrooms, and to submit the names of those teachers at the stakeholder meeting prior to the public random assignment of the intervention. Baseline surveys of all teachers were conducted prior to the beginning of the school year. In addition, information on teacher attendance and performance was collected during random checks over the course of the school year. Compliance with this procedure was very high, and the data collection team noted all deviations from the pre-assignment of teachers to classrooms. 

•	For the Phase 2 schools, head teachers were asked to nominate teachers prior to learning their school’s treatment status by whatever process they normally use, and then provide their names to Mango Tree prior to the lottery that was done to determine which schools are assigned to which study arm.

   
D.	Assignment of Students to Classrooms

One potential concern with the presence of two P1-P3 classrooms in each school is that the effect of an individual teacher may be hard to separate from that of the overall program. In particular, students may attempt to switch into the classroom with the stronger teacher, exaggerating the LLP’s effects. To mitigate this issue, students in schools with two (or more) classrooms will be randomly assigned to one of the two classrooms by the school’s head teacher. This will prevent any potential confounding from classroom-switching. It also helps ensure that the classroom assignments are fair, with each student having an equal chance of being paired with each teacher. This is particularly important in situations where more than two P1-P3 classrooms exist at a school.

This randomization will happen during two school years: 2013 and 2016. In 2013, the random assignment was conducted by using specialized enrollment rosters for the P1 classes in all 38 Phase 1 schools. Mango Tree staff carried pre-printed rosters with spaces for each students’ name and other details, along with an assignment to stream A or stream B. The assignments were generated at random using the runiform() function in Stata 11 SE.  The head teachers were instructed to copy over the student names onto these rosters in order from their own records, and use the listed assignment for each student. Any late-enrolling students were added in the order they arrived. This process was validated by Mango Tree staff field visits, and a copy of each roster was collected and used to select students for examinations. We aim to follow the same procedure in 2016, for all 128 schools in the MT program, CCT program, and control groups, as long as the school has more than one classroom.","","Public lottery, stratified on baseline school attributes including geography.",School,"158 schools (30 are pure controls with no students sampled, except at the end of the study)

Cross-Randomization A: All full treatment schools research wall clocks and slates. Wall clocks and slates were randomly allocated among schools (in any grade in the sample) in the half-treatment and control arms. 20 received slates only, 23 received clocks only, 20 received both, and 23 received none.
Cross-Randomization B: Individual-level randomization of households (parents) to receive different types of report cards on their child’s performance in school. These report cards will be provided at school meetings. While the exact attendance at these meetings is hard to forecast, our best estimate is that an average of 70 parents per school to attend from each of the 128 schools in the full treatment, half-treatment, and control groups. This would yield a total sample size of roughly 9000. ",Please see the separate Power Calculations document under Supporting Documents & Materials.

The design is an individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) and will involve 200 TB patients during their ‘continuation phase’ of treatment. The trial will have two arms; 100 patients will form the control group and receive the standard provision of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) and 100 will receive Virtually Observed Treatment (VOT). VOT differs from DOT in that the daily observation of patients taking their medication will be observed via internet video calling rather than in-person. Based on a small sample of patient interviews we think that for some patients DOT may be a hindrance rather than a help. VOT allows patients to take their treatment in the comfort of their home and means they don’t have to travel to their polyclinic every day. The trial design will be implemented by Act for Involvement (AFI) and the Ministry of Health in Moldova. The trial will be available to patients that have access to a computer, smartphone or any device that can run Skype. Two VOT observation centres will be set up; one at AFI and one in an existing polyclinic. The trial duration will dependent on the number of eligible patients but is expected to take 16 months.
",2015-02-02,2015-11-02,"The primary outcome measure for the trial will be the number of days per two week period that each patient fails to adhere to treatment (continuous). Only patients that are observed will be counted. This will be collected continuously through observation.
There will be a number of secondary outcome measures:
1)	Proportion of patients having more than 80% of scheduled medication sessions (binary) observed in participants with a minimum of 6 weeks follow up data. This is the target adherence rate used for a forthcoming trial of VOT by the NHS in the UK.
2)	Patient wellbeing – self reported using a short form version (5 questions) of the WEMWBS questionnaire for measuring mental wellbeing was developed by researchers at Warwick and Edinburgh Universities – collected at baseline and at 4 months
3)	Patient satisfaction. Whether a patient gives a positive response about their treatment on a likert scale (binary) – collected at baseline and at 4 months.
4)	Travel and time cost of treatment borne by patient, (self reported, continuous) – collected at 4 months.
5)	Employment (binary) – collected at baseline and at 4 months.
6)	Treatment success (binary) – collected at 4 months.
7)	Body mass index (BMI) (continuous) – collected at baseline and at 4 months.
8)	Side effects (self-reported, categorical) - collected at baseline and at 4 months.
We will also conduct a number of qualitative interviews with patients, non-randomly selecting a range of people and levels of adherence.
Adherence is regularly recorded on patient TB-01 record sheets at TB polyclinics. The time dimension of this data will give us additional power to detect results for the primary outcome measure. The trial will collect four months of adherence data for each patient. Trial duration is longer than data collection for each patient since patients will be starting their continuation phase treatment at different times. The patient wellbeing questionnaire will be conducted during the fourth month of treatment in the ambulatory phase for each patient.

Designing savings tools that help the poor to save is a global challenge that could benefit many.

We plan to exploit this key feature of the program to evaluate the potential of default and mental accounting mechanisms for a vulnerable population.

We consider as outcome variable self-reported savings in BANSEFI by Oportunidades beneficiaries who were given a debit card to manage their transfers. The data comes from INSP (2012). On average, beneficiaries report having MX$12.48 (standard deviation MX$271.67) saved in their accounts. We assume this to be the level of savings for the control group. Under the assumptions above, in order to detect a statistically significant difference of 0.2 standard deviations, considering 59 clusters (15 for the control group and 22 for each treatment group), we would need at least 20 complying households in each cluster.***

Considering the control group and assuming a 15% non-response rate at baseline, the number of households to be surveyed in each control locality is 24 (20/0.85). In addition, assuming a 15% attrition rate between baseline and endline, the number of households to be surveyed in each control locality is 29 (24/0.85 = 28.24 ≈ 29). Now, turning to the treatment groups, following the same reasoning and assuming a take-up rate of 25%, the number of households to be surveyed in each treatment locality is 113 (28.24/0.25 = 112.96 ≈ 113).

The trial will test an intervention focused around increasing the number of alternative extra-curricular activities for children as well as increasing information on them.The intervention, aimed at reducing the alcohol consumption of school students, has been designed with two specific behavioural insights in mind. The first is that the challenge of creating a successful intervention is made greater by the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ effect – the tendency, especially strong in young people, to actively react against being told what to do. The second is that talking about how bad the problem of teenage drinking may inadvertently increase the salience of drinking and lead to students thinking more of their peers drink than actually do. The intervention will therefore have two key components: 1) New activities - increasing the number of desirable alternative after-school activities for children, 2) Information on activities - increasing information on all after-school activities. The design is a cluster randomised trial with 10 schools out of 20 randomly assigned to receive the 'substitution activities' intervention.
",2015-01-05,2015-03-19,"The primary outcome measure for the trial will be a binary outcome of whether a student has drank any alcohol over the previous month (self-reported). We will also use a number of secondary outcome measures including:
•	Any alcohol consumption during past 7 days (self-reported)
•	Any alcohol consumption during past 3 months (self-reported)
•	Perceived level of drinking of peers (self-reported)
•	Consumption at hazardous levels (more than 5 drinks on one occasion in the last 30 days)
All outcome measures are self-reported due to two main reasons; 1) the numbers involved in alcohol related crime and alcohol related hospital admissions are too low, in 2013 there were only 126 incidents of alcohol related crime and 68 hospital admissions among young people in Lviv; 2) we were informed that testing for cerebellar functions or other measures of drinking would not be possible. Also of note is that the original design was to use the WHO AUDIT survey for detection of hazardous drinking levels (used in baseline survey – see Annex B and Annex C). However baseline results showed low levels of drinking, only 39% of students had ever drank alcohol before (see Annex D for further baseline results). We therefore chose to use any drinking of any alcohol over the past 30 days as our primary measure as this was more suitable to pick up changes in lower levels of drinking.
","","Cluster randomised design. 20 schools with 10 randomly allocated to receive the intervention. Outcome variables recorded at the student level (self reported). We estimate the impact of our treatment on five outcomes variables: First, whether a student has drank over the past 30 days. Second, whether a student has drank over the past 7 days. Third, whether a student has drank over the past 3 months. Fourth, perceived level of drinking of peers. Fifth, consumption at hazardous levels.
We will estimate a model of the form
:
D_i=z+ β_1 T_ji  + γφ_i+ U_i

Where D_i represents each of our outcome variables. z is a binary constant. This contains omitted categories, and so in this specification can be interpreted as the average propensity to drink of students in the control group. T is our treatment variable and set to 1 for all students in schools that received the substitution activities intervention. φ is a vector of control variables comprising student characteristics. Ui is an i.i.d. error term. Standard errors will be clustered at the school level.","","20 schools chosen by UNDP form our sample. Schools were stratified based on two criteria. First schools were ranked in order of baseline levels of previous drinking. These schools were then grouped into 5 strata of 4 schools based on these rankings (i.e. taking the top four schools, then the next four, and so on). Within these strata the schools were then ranked in order of school size and then split into pairs in a similar manner. This process served to create pairs of similar schools based on these criteria, one of which would be assigned to receive the intervention and one to be a part of the control group. One school from each pair was then randomly allocated to receive treatment (based on random number generation in excel)",School,20 Schools,1700,"10 schools treatment, 10 schools control",15% increase in self reported drinking (0.310 st dev)

Methods and materials: One hundred and twenty children (4-18 years old) diagnosed as functional constipation according to ROME III criteria were assigned to receive a traditional dry cupping protocol on abdominal wall for 8 minutes every other day or standard laxative therapy (Poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 40% solution without electrolyte), 0.4 g/kg once daily) for 4 weeks, in an open label randomized controlled clinical trial using a parallel design with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients were evaluated prior to and following 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention commencement in terms of the ROME III criteria for functional constipation.
Results: There were no significant differences between the two arms regarding demographic and clinical basic characteristics. After two weeks of the intervention, there was a significant better result in most of items of ROME III criteria of patients in PEG group. By contrast after four weeks of the intervention the result was significantly better in the cupping group. There was no significant difference in the number of patients with constipation after 4 and 8 weeks of follow up period.
Conclusion: This study showed that dry cupping of abdominal wall, as a traditional manipulative therapy, can be as effective as standard laxative therapy in children with functional constipation.

The primary outcome was number of patients who had responded to the treatment. Response to the treatment was defined as improvement of constipation for at least to three bowel movements, soft stool and convenient defecation, no soiling and bloody stool per week as well as not full filling the Rome III criteria for constipation after the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks of intervention.  Secondary outcomes were frequency of defecation, presence of fecal soiling (encopresis), hard stool consistency, retention posturing and abdominal pain, at the mentioned time periods.

If these problems are not addressed at an early stage, children can fall further and further behind in class, making it even more difficult for them to succeed to school. Additionally, low self-confidence and frustration may compound the problem, threatening the child’s future forever. For this reason, identifying and addressing learning problems at an early age is an important challenge for any education system. Remedial education is one possible way to tackle these difficulties. The intervention, provided by a publicly funded NGO, consists of offering to five underachievers in first grade an intensive tutoring program (four 1.5 hour  sessions each week) focused on reading books and informal language games.

Despite massive improvements in enrollment rates over the past 20 years, over 775 million adults worldwide—or 18 percent of the population—are still unable to read and write in any language (UNESCO 2012.  These indicators are particularly low in the landlocked countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where literacy rates typically range between 30 and 50 percent.  In Niger, the subject of our study, fewer than 30 percent of the population is literate, with large discrepancies between men and women.

While there is a substantial amount of research on how to increase school participation, especially for school-aged children, there is still considerable debate about how to improve learning in a cost-effective way.  A number of randomized evaluations have shown that spending on particular inputs has not increased test scores, thereby leading to general skepticism about the value of such inputs (Hanushek 1995, Glewwe, Kremer and Moulin 2009).  Yet a key question emerging from many of these studies is whether such inputs are relevant to the local context. 

Despite the immediate private and social returns to adult education, adult education programs are a highly neglected entry point for development interventions.  This is often attributed to low enrollment, high drop-out and rapid skills depreciation (Romain and Armstrong 1987, Abadzi 1994, Oxenham et al 2002, Ortega and Rodriguez 2008), possibly due to the limited relevance of such skills in daily life or limited opportunities to practice in one’s native language.

The widespread growth of mobile phone coverage in many developing countries, including Niger, has the potential to increase the incentives for and facilitate the acquisition of literacy and numeracy skills by illiterate adults (Aker et al 2012).  By teaching students how to use mobile phones, adult learners may be able to practice their literacy skills outside of class by sending and receiving short message services (SMS), making phone calls and using mobile money (m-money) applications, all of which require basic fluency with the numbers, symbols and letters on mobile phone keypads. Mobile phone technology could also affect returns to education by allowing households to use the technology for other purposes, such as obtaining price and labor market information and facilitating informal private transfers (Aker and Mbiti 2010, Jack and Suri forthcoming).

Our research team ran a successful randomized evaluation in Niger in 2009-2011 (Project ABC) and showed that a mobile phone-enhanced adult education program improved literacy and math skills of adult education participants by 19-25 standard deviations, equivalent to an additional year of education (Aker et al 2012).  This difference remains significant over time, even as learning depreciates. The results were not only cost effective as compared with the regular adult education intervention, but also as compared with other education interventions also cost effective, costing less than $US 2 for every additional .1 s.d. increase in test scores (Evans and Ghosh 2008).

This research will build upon the existence research in five ways. First, this new research will assess the impact of the traditional adult education program (without mobile phones), which was not possible in previous work.  Second, the mobile phone-based literacy program will be implemented in more villages and more literacy participants, allowing us to determine whether the results remain once scaled. Third, the program will be implemented without the distribution of shared mobile phones, thereby overcoming an important cost constraint to implementation by the Ministry of Non-Formal Education (MNEF).  Fourth, the program will assess the potential role of mobile phone technology in distance learning by providing educational content on agriculture and health-related themes over the mobile phone.  Finally, the research will assess the impact of both the adult education and ABC program on other economic outcomes, self-esteem and self-efficacy and educational attainment of children, key issues justifying the investment in adult education programs (Blunch and Portner 2011, Banerji et al 2013).  And finally, the program will assess the way in which education and technology affect intra-household and inter-village dynamics. 

This study will use a randomized evaluation methodology, whereby villages within two regions of Niger will be randomly assigned to either a treatment (an adult education program with or without a mobile learning component) or control (no adult education program).  We will also cross-cut these treatments by assigning certain villages to the SMS-based adult education program.  In addition, a subset of villages in each group will be assigned to mobile phone monitoring, in an attempt to understand whether information technology can reduce the moral hazard problem.
",2014-03-01,2015-08-31,"The key quantitative outcomes of interest in this research are as follows: 1) Individual level (students’ test scores, including literacy tests, math tests, self-esteem and self-efficacy); 2) Household level (farm and agricultural marketing outcomes, investments in children’s education, health knowledge and intra-household bargaining); and 3) Child level (test scores and cognitive tests).

In addition, for the monitoring research, we will also collect attendance data at the student and teacher level, as well as village-level infrastructure data. ","","Our research design will use a randomized control trial with randomized assignment to different treatment variations.  Out of the 500 villages in the project, we will randomly assign 175 villages to one of four interventions:  1) a traditional adult education program; 2) a mobile phone-enhanced education program (ABC); 3) a mobile phone content program (ABC2); or 4) no program.  Within the third treatment, randomization of the message type, frequency and intensity will occur at the individual level, thereby providing variation in the extent to which other learners in the network of a particular individual are treated.  These messages will include simple reminders, technical and non-technical information, which will allow us to disentangle the impact of the information provided from the impact of receiving a message.  Since the randomization of messages will be at the individual level, we will be able to provide evidence on the cost-effectiveness of sending messages to all individuals, as well as spillover impacts between recipients and non-recipients.  The identification of the impact of both the adult education and ABC programs is based upon the assumption that random assignment will balance observable and unobservable characteristics prior to the program to ensure that the groups are comparable. The unit of randomization will be at the village level.   Villages will be stratified by region and sub-region before being randomly assigned to one of three interventions.  ","","The randomization will be conducted in an office by a computer program (STATA), and shared with the NGO.",Village and individual level.,The planned number of clusters is 175.,We plan to have approximately 2625 individuals,"There are 75 schools in the adult education program, 75 in the ABC program and 25 in the comparison group.

Financial Education vs. Access to Finance in Transnational Households,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/342,"August 19, 2015",2015-08-19 11:29:37 -0400,AEARCTR-0000342,"Dean Yang, deanyang@umich.edu",in_development,2014-04-30,2016-04-30,"[""education"", ""finance"", """"]","","The potential of international migration to provide immediate and large income gains to migrant households have generated interest in programs that can enhance its development impacts. We compare the impact of financial education with that of access to financial services and products, and measure complementarities between the two programs. The study population comprises of households in Cabanatuan, Philippines with a family member abroad. To establish a causal effect, we use random assignment of households to financial education sessions or access to financial services or both. The outcomes of interest are variables related to long-term financial security of transnational households where the migrant workers are mostly female. These include formal saving, remittance expenditures, borrowings, wages and entrepreneurial activities.",2014-04-30,2015-12-31,"Through financial education migrant households may be better able to allocate the remittances to productive investments. After all, besides their direct impact on current family incomes, remittances are used to fund future investments. In fact, for many households with limited access to credit, remittances may be their only source of finance. Thus, remittances are channeled into investment goods or for small businesses. Families also use them to pay school fees, thereby investing in human capital. A small component of remittances are also used to purchase land and property, as well as to repair and upgrade homes. We would establish the impact of the program by tracking these outcomes via surveys implemented among migrant families during the course of the research project. Further, through the administrative data provided by ASKI and BPI, we would be able to study the usage of financial products and microloans by both migrants and their households. 

If we have enough funds to survey migrants located abroad, we will also measure the effect on migrant savings, remittance amounts and channels, frequency of remittances and communication between the migrant and households. 

The study team will administer migrants and origin households a baseline survey. Usage of financial products at ASKI and BPI will be tracked using administrative data. A pre-analysis plan for analyses to be conducted will be lodged with The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL) prior to the start of baseline fieldwork to forestall later concerns about selective reporting of results. Endline surveys conducted 12 months later will establish impacts on financial outcomes more broadly (beyond outcomes that can be observed in the administrative data). 

Randomization ensures that observations are similar on average across treatment conditions, so simple comparison of means across treatments establishes impacts. The primary interest is in outcomes such as control over remittances, savings, remittance amounts and frequency, educational expenditures, housing investments etc.

Examining the impact of financial education and the provision of financial services on various financial decisions and outcomes suggests running the following regression:

Yi = f + b1R1i + b2C1i + b3R1iC1i + ei  	

Let Yi be the value of a dependent variable of interest, such as savings, control over remittances, amount and frequency of remittances, educational or housing expenditures of households in the Philippines, etc. R1 is an indicator variable indicating assignment to treatment groups in row 1 of the chart, and C1 is an indicator variable for assignment to treatments in column 1. The constant term f is the value of the dependent variable for households who were assigned to Treatment 0, while ei is a mean-zero error term. The coefficients b1 and b2 provide the impact of the financial education program and financial services access respectively while the coefficient b3 measures of the complementarity of providing both financial education and services to the migrant and their household.
","","The IPA survey team will administer a baseline survey to consenting migrant households upon locating them using the contact information provided by OWWA or through the door-to-door campaign. Migrants at this point will most likely be already abroad. We interview the household head among remaining household members.

The study sample will then be randomly subdivided into different treatment conditions on-site. First, households will be randomized into either a financial education treatment, or into a group that receives no financial education at all. Second, households will be independently cross-randomized into being offered access to formal credit, insurance, and savings products, or into a group that is not offered financial access. This will generate four treatment conditions with 450 households in each.  The chart below maps the four groups:

Treatment 0 (control group): This is the control condition: No offer of financial education program and/or financial services. The sealed envelope will merely contain a “thank you” letter for participating in the baseline survey.

Treatment 1: Invitation to attend a financial education program: The household head will be invited to attend a short workshop on financial education in ASKI’s training center.  The workshop will be free and will be scheduled on a Saturday. It will last 6-8 hours and will be completed in one day. To facilitate take-up, the household head will be allowed to bring a companion. A letter will provide details and will ask the household head to indicate interest in the program. OWWA will also provide a letter endorsing participation in the financial education program, which we expect to raise take-up.

Treatment 2: Access to financial services and products: This treatment group will only be provided access to financial services and products and will not be offered any form of financial literacy training. In particular, they will be invited to avail of 4 different products:

1.	A BPI Savings Account – a regular savings account with low required maintaining balance, which can be used to receive remittances from migrant members abroad.
	
2.	ASKI microloan – a small loan for enterprise development.

3.	ASKI micro-insurance - accident or property insurance. Accident insurance covers losses caused by accidental death or bodily injury due to accident occurring in any place in the world. Property insurance covers property damage resulting from a peril. 

Households in this treatment group will be provided with a letter that specifies requirements, and would indicate instructions from where and how they can avail of the products in addition to specifying a contact person to talk to. In addition, the surveyors will offer households immediate registration for a ASKI micro-insurance product, should they wish to register on the spot. 

Treatment 3: Invitation to a financial education program and access to BPI Financial services and ASKI microloan facilities: This treatment group will be invited to attend both a financial education workshop and given access to financial services offered by BPI and ASKI, as in households in treatment groups 1 and 2.

The offer to attend a financial education program and to avail of financial products constitutes an encouragement design, since in practice we cannot prevent migrants and households from accessing these services independently. That said, past research (Ashraf, Aycinena, Martinez & Yang 2011) shows that mere offers and assistance with opening bank accounts lead to large differences in bank account usage in transnational households. Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012) find that attendance rates for financial literacy training in Indonesia have a high take-up rate when offered for free and done in coordination with accredited recruitment agencies, even when the training is done separately for migrant workers and family members. Their experiment involved assigning migrants to a migrant-only training group, a family member-only training group, and a joint training group. The take-up rates were 81.2 percent, 76.5 percent, and 65 percent respectively. We expect our offers to be similarly effective, as the government endorses it.","",Randomization will be conducted on-site,Randomization will be at the household level.,"1,800 households","1,800 households","450 households control

","Assumptions:

Assume a minimum detectable effect size of .2 standard deviations when standardizing the mean values of the outcome variables of interest.

Assume a take-up rate for the invitation to attend the financial education workshops of 90%. This is based on Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia (2012) and Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012) who also run financial literacy training workshops for migrants.

Assume take-up rates for offered financial products to be 80%. In other words, 80% of study participants use some financial product, whether credit or savings, when offered to them. The assumption is based on a midrange of take-up rates for field experiments that study random provision of credit or savings products.

Effect 1: The impact of the financial education workshop (b1)
Power = 0.9684  

Effect 2: The impact of financial services (b2)
Power = 0.9242 

Effect 3: The joint impact of financial education and financial services (b3)
Power = 0.8508 

Ultimately, even beyond these power calculations, we are confident that 1800 households is an adequate sample size to detect our main effects, even for our mini-experiment in Singapore and Hong Kong where the financial education treatment group involves training migrants abroad. The study by Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012), who look at similar outcomes, had enough power to detect statistically significant effects even with a sample of only 400 migrant households randomized into three treatment groups. According to administrative data by OWWA, 19.7% of migrants departing for abroad from Cabanatuan City went to Singapore and Hong Kong in 2013. Hence, we expect to obtain a similar subsample of around 355 for the mini experiment."

In 2010, while the overall unemployment rate was 9%, it had reached 16.6% and 55.8% respectively for men and women between 20 and 24 (ILO, statistics). Both theoretical and anecdotal evidence suggest that fostering youth entrepreneurship may be an adequate policy to tackle these issues. In particular, while 53.6% of young Egyptians express a preference for having their own business over a salaried job, only 1.2% are self-employed due to credit constraints and a lack of business information (Population Council, 2009). However there is still little robust evidence showing a causal impact of programs promoting entrepreneurship on labour market indicators or indicating the most effective mode of delivery for such trainings.

As part of the Taqeem initiative (a project by ILO’s Youth Employment Network and Silatech), we propose to evaluate the effects of an innovative youth entrepreneurship reality TV show in Egypt, El Mashrou3 by Bamyan Media. El Mashrou3 uses an entertaining approach to teach an expected audience of 8-10 million Egyptians entrepreneurial skills and good business practices, and to introduce them to local partners delivering entrepreneurship training, mentorship, finance and technology services etc. In addition to the show, support activities will be carried out to create a bridge between the reality show and the real world: a website will be created so that viewers may find online courses, educational videos, mentoring services etc., and viewing parties as well as networking events will also be organized. 

We will run a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the combined effects of our interventions. As the TV show is being broadcasted nationally on a satellite channel and the website is available to all, we propose to use an encouragement design. Respondents will be randomly allocated to different groups differing only by the amount of encouragements they will receive to watch the show and participate in the support activities. Paying close attention to heterogeneous and personal network effects, we will evaluate the impact of the interventions on business practices, employment status, skills and attitudes towards business.

We ran a cluster randomised controlled trial in 2011-12 in which 15-16 year old students were provided with information about graduate salaries through an activity-based lesson lasting one hour. The lesson was taught by the normal class teacher using resources provided for the intervention. The information on graduate salaries was taken from a study by O'Leary and Sloane (2011) which used data from the Labour Force Survey. The education system in England encourages relatively early specialization. Most students who remain in full-time education between the ages of 16 and 18 study a small (3-5) number of subjects which are designed to prepare for undergraduate study. Undergraduates typically study their major from their freshman year onwards. We measured the effect of the intervention on students' choice of subject using the records supplied by the school showing which subjects students were studying in 2012/13 when the students were aged between 16 and 17. Data were collected by questionnaires before and after the intervention lesson. These data were linked to data available on the National Pupil Database. We were therefore able to control for a range of student characteristics including prior achievement, parental education, ethnicity, cultural capital and expressed intentions towards subjects they might study. 

A priori we conducted a power calculation assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1 and an average school size of 83, which suggested that 48 schools would give 80% power to detect a 0.3 difference in outcomes using a two-tailed test at α=0.05. We generated a pool of potential participants through a list of all schools within a large and diverse geographical area within England which satisfied our criteria: serving the age range 13-18 and having at least 100 students in their ‘sixth forms’ (students in the academic year for students aged 16-17 and the academic year for students aged 17-18). We also stratified our sample to include 20 private schools and 30 state schools. These criteria meant that the average achievement of students in our sample was significantly higher than the average for all 15-16 year-old students in England. Schools satisfying these criteria were placed in a random order and approached in that order until we had secured firm agreement for participation. The total project sample included 50 schools and 5,593 students. Ten schools withdrew part way through the project. Six schools (571 students) allocated to the intervention arm did not take part in the intervention and four schools (487 students) allocated to the control did not take part in the questionnaire administered after the intervention. As per the recommendations for reporting randomised trials (Moher et al. 2001) we report results using an intention to treat analysis. We used the mi routines in Stata to impute missing data.

Bangladeshi garment factories are organized into several sewing lines which produce independently from another for different orders and buyers. Sewing lines producing garments that have already been produced by other lines in the factory before, are significantly more productive in the first days producing the new garment. Initial analysis by the author shows that these `spill-over' effects are stronger when the supervisors on the first and later lines to produce the garment report social ties in surveys. This intervention is designed to obtain additional evidence on the sources of the observed spill-over. Several garment factories agreed to implement a new management routine among randomly selected sewing lines. If a selected line start producing a garment that has already been produced on another line in the factory, the line supervisor from the first line producing the garment is actively involved in setting up the new line for the garment. If this intervention magnifies observed productivity spill-over, this would be indicative for spill-over being caused by sharing of knowledge between supervisors from the lines, as opposed to superiors or other persons (engineers, planners) applying their knowledge obtained on earlier lines producing the garment to later lines producing it, or other possible confounding sources. ",2014-05-21,2015-03-31,"The outcome variable measuring the impact of the management intervention is daily productivity of a line on the first X days it produces a garment which it has not produced before. Productivity will be measured in three different ways. The first is using the formula that also the partner factories themselves are using to calculate line productivity for their own production monitoring: daily piece-wise output is multiplied with the garment specific ""SMV"" value (""Standard Minute Value""). This value for each garment is calculated by the factory's engineering department prior to the start of production, and gives the required minutes of labor input to finish all the necessary sewing operations, under ideal production circumstances, and given the machinery available at the factory. It is calculated both to form a basis for a price quote for the order to the buyer, and to help plan the required labor for producing the order. Multiplying piece-wise output with the SMV gives an `output-minutes' value which is comparable across different garments. To obtain the first productivity measure, this output-minutes value is then divided by the ""input-minutes"" value, the number of workers on the line times the number of hours the line was operating on that day times 60 minutes. 
In a second measure, output_minutes are directly regressed on the explanatory variables, controlling for input_minutes as right-hand-side variable. 
Third, a productivity measure will be constructed which resembles more closely TFP measures. Average hourly output_minutes on a day are regressed on the input minutes, separated by the two main types of workers in the lines (""operator"" and ""helper""), and the residual is taken as productivity. 

","","The intervention is carried out by the upper factory management (""General Manager"", ""Head Production Engineer""), under our guidance. The implementation is tracked by the tablet or book system explained above. Lines are randomly selected to obtain the treatment. In the first three factories, to test several forms of randomization, In one part of the factory, the lines were selected together in terms of sewing floors, that is sewing floors (typically containing 5-10 lines) were randomly selected. In other floors, the randomization occurred on the line level. This was done to test whether it is feasible to directly randomize on the line level. As in the initial three factories, the randomization on the line level seems to have been understood and followed, from the forth factory starting the implementation, randomization will be solely on the line level, to avoid cluster sample size concerns.","",In front of factory managers in computer (MS Office Excel random number drawer),"In the first three factories starting the intervention, the floors of the factories were separated into two groups (factories in general strive to keep lines and floors as interchangeable as possible, to allow maximum flexibility of allocating orders to lines, given the volatile order situation of most factories, with all factories in my sample having at least 10 different buyer). In the one group of floors, randomization was on the floor level (which typically contain 5-10 lines). In the other group, the randomization was done on the line level, to test if the factory management can implement this comparatively more complex randomization. As floors are deliberately kept as interchangeably as possible, the groups of floors for floor or line level randomization, respectively, were determined simply by assigning group level randomization to all floors except the last one, and line level randomization to the last floor (with last floor meaning the floor with the highest number in the internal floor counting system of the factory). From the fourth factory on implementing the program, the randomization will be at the line level only.

I assume an effect of an additional 3 percentage points due to our intervention. Standard deviation of first-day efficiency is 20 percentage points. I assume per cluster on average 20 observations of a garment being started for the first time on that line (or floor). Based again on the first two factories, I calculate an intra-cluster correlation of 0.075. To detect an effect of a size of 3 additional percentage points on a significance level of 5%, I therefore need at least 227 clusters.  "

At its core, the AGEP incorporates a Safe Spaces program, implemented in partnership with YWCA Zambia. At weekly girls’ group meetings, 20 to 30 girls meet with a mentor—a young woman from their community—for short training sessions on a variety of topics as well as a chance to discuss important experiences of the past week. The primary goal of the safe spaces groups is to reduce the social isolation while increasing the assets of adolescent girls. The Safe Spaces groups meet for a period of two years.

Two additional components have been added to the Safe Spaces model for the AGEP program. In the first component, selected girls in the AGEP are assisted in opening bank accounts to manage their money. The Population Council is working in partnership with the National Savings and Credit Bank (NatSave) and Making Cents International to develop the “Girls Dream” Savings Account. The second add-on component of AGEP is a health voucher that will be provided to selected girls in the program. In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Mobile Transactions Zambia, the Council is developing a health voucher that will be redeemable for a package of health services at certain public and private health providers, including MoH public facilities. The services covered by the voucher include basic wellness exams as well as age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. 

In addition to expanding the assets and potential of adolescent girls in Zambia, a principal feature of AGEP is rigorous research and evaluation of program impact. In conjunction with program activities, Council researchers will conduct a four-year impact evaluation of the program using a randomized cluster design. The study will follow participants for the two-year intervention period and for two years after completion of the intervention to assess longer-term impact. Communities where AGEP is being implemented will be randomly assigned one of three different versions of the intervention: (1) the full program (safe spaces, savings accounts, and health vouchers), (2) safe spaces with a health voucher, or (3) safe spaces only. Program participants will be compared with a control group of adolescent girls not participating. 

The research and evaluation will assess the impact of AGEP on vulnerable adolescent girls’ longer-term demographic, reproductive, and health outcomes. In addition to survey data, biomarker data will be collected among older participants to measure incidence and prevalence of STIs, specifically Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2). In addition, anemia testing will be conducted among study participants aged 15+ years and their children aged 6−59 months to measure prevalence of anemia. The research will investigate how AGEP changes vulnerable adolescent girls’ lives as they age from 10–19 in 2013 (baseline) to 14–23 in 2017; the study participants will be revisited annually. The adolescent cohort study will include: 1) quantitative structured interviews; 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews; 3) HIV and HSV-2 testing (at three points in time); 4) anemia testing, and 5) assessment of adolescents’ children gross and fine motor skills.

Public lottery at second stage","The AGEP operates in ten master sites clustered around health service sites that allow concentrated implementation within them. A two stage randomization process was developed for selection. In the first stage of randomization, a sampling frame containing matched binary or triplets of public health clinics that are proximal to each other will be generated for districts in the selected AGEP provinces. For a matched pair or triplet of health clinics to be included, it must also be within a reasonable distance to a NatSave branch. For rural areas, a fixed distance (15 kilometers) catchment area will be defined around the selected health centers to obtain a sufficient number of clusters for sampling. The health center groupings will be sampled randomly, proportional to catchment population size. It is believed that this randomization and sampling strategy will obtain a representative sample of the population in these provinces and eligible adolescent girls to achieve a reasonable degree of external validity.

The second stage of randomization will assign CSAs (“communities”) within master sites to control or experimental arms. The sampling frame will be defined by and contain approximately 20 to 40 census supervisory areas (CSAs) within each master site, with each CSA containing two to five contiguous statistical enumeration areas (SEAs). In urban areas, a similar number of catchment area CSAs will be enumerated, although no distance criteria is needed as there are sufficient numbers of CSAs in close proximity from which to select due to population density. Across the ten master program areas it is expected that there will be anywhere from 250 to 400 CSAs forming the sampling frame for this level of randomization. This amounts to approximately 25 to 40 CSAs from which to randomly draw and assign in each master site. In the four-arm RCD, approximately 12 CSAs will be selected for AGEP and four for the control arm. This will leave anywhere from 4 to 24 CSAs per site not participating in either the program or research.  an additional four ‘external’ control CSAs will be selected for the urban study sites.  A sufficient number of girls will be recruited to obtain the participation of approximately 1,000 girls for each master site at baseline.

Estimates indicate that 40 communities per arm of the study are required with a minimum of 25 girls per cluster at baseline. Thus, a four-arm study (control and three experimental or program arms) require implementing AGEP in 120 communities and conducting the research in 160 communities. Estimates of cluster number and sample sizes were conducted for different baseline age groups (10-14, 10-16 and 10-19) and scenarios for the number of study arms.

Despite of subsequent advances in anesthesia and surgical care, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) still are a significant problem in modern practice. 
This study was done to investigate the effect of deep respiratory effect on oxygenation of patient under major abdominal surgery. 

Design: In this single-blind randomized clinical trial which was done in surgery ward of Shahid Beheshti Hospital in QOM in 2012, forty elective patients who needed major 
abdominal surgery participated in this study and were divided to two equal groups(control and experimental). Control group had been received routine care but experimental 
group in addition of ordinary care, repeated deep respiratory exercise four times an hour for 2 consecutive hours. The arrangement of patients about their position, mobility 
and oxygen therapy were the same. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, mean blood pressure and the severity of pain in surgery site were measured before and 
after intervention. Chi-square test, Fischer exact test, t-test, Paired t- test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, loan test and Manvitini test were used for data 
analyzing. 
Findings: Before intervention, two groups had no significant difference about demographic characteristics, intermediary factors in oxygenation, the severity of pain in surgery 
site, pulse rate, mean artery blood pressure, respiratory rate ,and O2 saturation(P>0.05).After the intervention, the change of O2 saturation and the severity of pain in surgery 
site were significant (P<0.05).Furthermore the results revealed, the deep respiratory exercise can reduce the pain of surgery site and mean blood pressure and increase the 
O2 saturation in experimental group.

We shall measure childhood diarrhoea, household drinking-water and sachet use, and vendors’ sachet sales in the pilot to gain insights into how sachet voucher provision affects households and vendors. If feasible, we propose to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial to measure the health impact and cost-effectiveness of providing subsidised sachet water to young children in Accra. In this main trial, by examining differences in diarrhoea rates and growth in children in different study arms, we plan to assess whether greater sachet use as a result of subsidy or free provision protects against water-borne disease and thus contribute to child growth and development. This will allow us to assess whether the costs of sachet water regulation or subsidy are justified by reductions in diarrhoeal disease and child mortality.

This study explores ways to counter these tendencies using online exercises and electronic messaging.  Randomly selected students at a 4-year college are randomized into three treatment groups and a control.  The first group is given an online goal-setting exercise to think about their future and what steps to take now to help them achieve their goals.  The second group is offered additional electronic messages containing advice, information, motivation, and reminders, with the aim of improving performance, experience, and completion.

Yet access to financial services is a key aspect of development, as credit and savings allow households to invest, save and respond to shocks.  Households typically deal with limited access to financial services by using “at home savings” (i.e., under a mattress), saving with collectors (i.e., susu) or forming “rotating savings clubs” that allow each member to save a set amount on a weekly basis.  Each of these strategies plays an important role in terms of promoting savings and helping households to meet different savings goals.  Although savings groups provide a commitment to save and are often more secure, the savings can only be accessed when the group “shares out”, which might not coincide with the household’s needs. While savings “under the mattress” provide household with ready access to its savings, such savings is generally riskier (theft, loss and fire) and is more susceptible to “temptation” or “ceremonial” spending.  Ceremonial spending is particularly important in countries where the entire village is expected to contribute to weddings, baptisms or funerals, or when a particular religious festival – such as the Muslim festival of Tabaski – requires purchasing livestock for household consumption and is a lumpy expenditure.  In addition to spending on ceremonial festivals, most rural households report that spending on unforeseen health expenses is their greatest financial challenge.  

Since the early 2000s, mobile phone coverage and services have grown rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa.  As of 2012, over 376 million people had mobile phones, thereby allowing households to communicate more quickly and more cheaply over long distances.  Mobile communication provides new potential to increase the financial inclusion of the world’s poor.  In particular, m-money could be used to create a secure electronic savings account, where individuals can deposit their savings (interest free).  In addition, by combining m-money with text message reminders, these dual technologies could encourage individuals to save for particular objectives, particularly addressing the issue of limited attention (Karlan, McConnell, Mullainathan and Zinman 2012, McConnell 2013) in savings.  In particular, if individuals in Niger are more likely to forget future lumpy expenditures, such as spending on goats for religious expenditures, as compared with future income, then this can lead to present bias towards consumption (Karlan et al 2012). 

This research seeks to understand how mobile phone technology can be used to promote savings in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on the case of rural Niger. In particular, the purpose of this research is provide insights into whether: 1) SMS reminders about savings goals increase individuals’ ability to save, particularly in the face of pressures for ceremonial expenditures; and 2) whether access to a simple savings technology (a savings box) can facilitate savings goals, either by allowing individual members of savings groups to save, promoting particular savings objectives or providing a secure place to safe.",2013-09-27,2014-10-31,"The study will measure the impact of the interventions on income and expenditures, expenditures for particular religious festivals, health, weddings and baptisms, and how they are financed; savings patterns and goals; mental health related to financial stability; asset ownership (including livestock) and knowledge of livestock prices.

","","We assess the impact of the intervention described above by conducting a clustered randomized controlled trial on a sample drawn from FINO’s pilot client base in Andhra Pradesh, India. 
Our study has two main arms: On one hand we provide training, incentives and access to a mobile platform we have developed to selected BCAs during group training sessions conducted at the block level; and on the other hand, we invite a subsample of end-customers to use a similar financial information mobile platform directly. We describe each of these arms successively. 
1: BCA-level intervention
FINO’s pilot happened in 117 blocks of 4 districts of Andhra Pradesh, and includes 2600+ BCAs. In the first arm of this study, we randomly select and assign, at the block level, 1000 BCAs to one of five treatment statuses: 
1.	16% of blocks are assigned to receiving no information 
2.	Sampled BCAs in 21% of blocks are assigned to receiving information about the new EBT-NFA product only
3.	Sampled BCAs in 21% of blocks are assigned to receiving information about the new EBT-NFA product, plus are incentivized based on the savings achievements of their customers
4.	Sampled BCAs in 21% of blocks are assigned to receiving information about the new EBT-NFA product, plus are given access to the financial information mobile platform and in-person training on how to encourage one’s customers to save
5.	Sampled BCAs in 21% of blocks are assigned to receiving information about the new EBT-NFA product, given access to the mobile platform and training on how to encourage savings, and incentivized based on the savings achievements of their customers. 

BCAs located in blocks assigned to group 1, or non-sampled BCAs of blocks assigned to groups 2 to 5 will not be contacted, and no identifiable information will be obtained from them. We will only use administrative data provided by FINO including unidentifiable transaction data from their customers, and exploit average variation in savings achievements between groups. 
The 1000 sampled BCAs assigned to groups 2-5 will first be invited by phone to participate in a training session of the same format as the training sessions usually held by FINO: They will be called up by our team and informed that they have been randomly selected to take part in a pilot conducted jointly by FINO and CMF. 
BCAs who agree to participate will then be informed of the time and place of the session to be held; all sessions will be held within the block the BCA lives in, conducted jointly by CMF staff and FINO trainers, and transportation and food for the day will be paid for, even if participants leave before the end of the day. Sessions will include 6-12 participants depending on the block, and will take place on a single day, from 9.30am to 6pm at the most. Participants completing the 1h-long end-of-day survey will be compensated with INR 30 (~USD 0.50), which corresponds to approximately the income from 2 hours work of a BCA. 
BCAs will then be informed of the features of the NFA-EBT bundled account, and taught how to practically provide these new services. BCAs assigned to groups 3 and 5 will be provided with explanations on a new incentive scheme applying to this pilot product and consisting of lotteries for gifts that they will be able to enter depending on the savings achievements of their customers (number of active accounts, average balance, etc.). The gifts will be adapted to the local population, and not exceed a value of INR 3000 (~USD 50).  
In addition to the basic training on the product, groups 4 and 5 will be trained on the benefits of savings and how to encourage people to save, using for this purpose a module developed and piloted by CMF in the course of a previous study. They will also be provided with access to and training on how to use the mobile platform we have developed with our technology partner, Awaaz.De. This platform, a voice-based interactive on-demand product, includes: (1) a browsing system to access information about financial products and practices, (2) a Q&A forum where they are able to ask any question to financial experts, and (3) the possibility to comment on or grade the messages delivered. It is also enabled to push information, either through recorded voice messages or SMS. The messages to be sent are developed by our financial experts, and carry important general financial information, as well as answers to relevant questions posted on the Q&A forum. Messages will be pushed no more than once a week, and participants will be informed that they are free to opt out of push calls.  Beyond the cost of owning a mobile phone, the only user-cost of the platform is airtime, which participants are informed will be covered by the CMF-FINO team for the length of the study. 
Finally, the session participants from all groups will be asked to (1) complete a self-assessed financial knowledge test, which lasts approximately 30 minutes and includes basic mathematics and financial literacy questions, and (2) answer a survey conducted individually and in-person by trained CMF surveyors. The survey questionnaire lasts approximately 45 minutes, and includes questions about basic demographics, financial habits, experience as a BCA, post-training financial knowledge, mobile usage and sources of financial information. 
BCAs from all 5 groups will then be observed for approximately 10 months. During this period, sampled BCAs will be contacted up to twice for follow-up phone surveys of maximum 20 minutes conducted by CMF surveyors. During these follow-up surveys they will be asked questions about their practice of the new EBT-NFA product, financial habits, sources of information and financial knowledge, as well as questions directly related to the platform (for those having access to it). Participants completing the full phone surveys will be compensated with INR 20 (USD 0.30) given in the form of immediate mobile top-ups. 
2. Customer-level intervention
In the second arm of this project, we select 1000 customers of the sampled BCAs, of which 50% are directly invited to use a financial helpline similar to the one described above, and the remaining 50% serve as control and receive no additional information. In order to ensure comparability between these two groups, the 1000 customers are selected so that they all own a mobile phone. 
During a face-to-face meeting with a CMF surveyor, we first explain to sampled customers that they have been randomly selected to participate in a study which is fully voluntary, and present all study features to them, including duration, compensation, and the fact that they might win free access to an innovative information platform for the length of the study. We emphasize that participation in this study implies accepting that researchers will access individual bank account data provided by FINO for the duration of the study, while of course making sure to separate all identifiable data from the rest of the data and securely storing the identified key code on IFMR’s cold-room computers and unidentified data on IFMR’s servers. All customers who agree to participate are then asked to answer a short in-person survey conducted by CMF surveyors, which includes baseline questions about socio-demographic characteristics, financial knowledge and habits, needs and sources of information and mobile usage. It should not last more than 30 minutes. Participants who complete the survey are compensated with INR 20 (USD 0.35) in immediate mobile top-ups. 
Once the survey is completed participants are provided with a card to scratch off in order to reveal whether or not they have won free access to the new mobile platform for the duration of the study. Participants assigned to the treatment group (those who won) are then given a description and training on how to use the mobile platform, during which an emphasis will be put on the fact that access to the platform will be free for the duration of the study.
Participants are also informed during this initial visit that they will be contacted once more for a follow-up phone survey where similar questions will be asked, and identical data security precautions will be applied. Participants completing the follow-up phone survey will be compensated with INR 20 (USD 0.30) given in the form of mobile top-ups and sent immediately to their phone.

At the same time, prepayment circumvents debt accumulation, allowing utility companies to serve otherwise high-cost customers. Researchers will collaborate with the municipal utility in Cape Town, South Africa to evaluate customer responses and revenue recovery for prepaid versus credit electricity metering. The study will generate new evidence on the impacts of prepaid meters on energy use and revenue recovery using both a randomized phase-in of new prepaid customers and a retrospective evaluation of historic transitions to prepaid meters in a ten year, household database of all municipal utility customers.  Researchers will explore how prepaid meters change the customer experience and the municipality’s revenue recovery.",2015-01-01,2015-04-30,"We will use two data sources to construct outcomes. First, we will use administrative data on electricity consumption (credit households) and electricity expenditures (prepaid households). These are official records from the City of Cape Town’s Electricity Department and provide outcomes at the customer level. We will also construct revenue and revenue recovery measures to analyze the impact of the meter on the City’s budget.

Second, we will gather survey data from a sub-sample of households that are part of the City’s prepaid installation project. The survey will be conducted in two waves, one after roughly half of the households have been targeted for conversion and a second after the installation project is complete. This will generate three groups of households for comparison: credit households (wave 1 only), households recently switched to a prepaid meter (waves 1 and 2) and households less recently switched to a prepaid meter (wave 2 only). The survey data will be used to analyze outcomes associated with four groups of hypotheses for why and how households are affected by prepaid electricity meters: (1) the implicit cost of electricity, (2) greater flexibility in expenditures, (3) salience of consumption, and (4) other psychological channels.
","","In collaboration with the researchers, the City will phase in the prepaid meters according to a randomized phase in design. The randomization unit is a block of approximately 200 geographically contiguous households. The 13 resulting blocks are assigned a random order and meter installation proceeds accordingly. Not all meters are installed according to the schedule. “Hold out” households receive meters late, and other households request installation before their randomization block is reached. Thus, compliance with treatment order is imperfect in both directions.

The study timeline is compressed by the demands of the City, which requires all prepaid conversions in Mitchells Plain to be complete by February. Consequently, the lag between the initial phase in block and the final phase in block will be short (~3 months), allowing for only short run impacts to be analyzed with the phase in design.

Analysis of outcomes from the administrative data will be conducted both with treatment assignment on the righthand side (ITT) and with the assigned treatment order as a predictor of actual treatment date (TOT). Using the panel nature of the data to introduce household fixed effects, a difference in difference regression will compare electricity usage outcomes (consumption or expenditure) between credit, newly prepaid and less newly prepaid households before and after the treatment date. Analysis of the survey outcomes will follow a similar design but rather than a continuous treatment timing variable, the survey will assign households to treatment (prepaid) and control (credit): their status at the time of the first survey wave.

Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have long stressed the importance of energy efficiency in any climate change mitigation strategy (Edenhofer et al. 2011), and the head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat recently hailed energy efficiency as ""the most promising means to reduce greenhouse gases in the short term” (Doyle 2007). This favored position is based on the poorly tested idea that energy-efficiency investments are a low-cost or even no-cost form of abatement, as energy savings make such investments profitable for firms.

The study tests this idea rigorously by conducting a randomized controlled trial of industrial energy audits in India, a fast-growing developing country whose future emissions will be important for global climate change. The project has been carried out among small and medium sized, energy-intensive industrial plants in the state of Gujarat; their technology choices and energy use were tracked against a comparable group of control firms. The study measures the relation between engineering projections for energy savings and actually achieved savings. It also tests two leading economic hypotheses for why industry may not adopt technologies that appear privately profitable: information market failures – based on asymmetries or undersupply – and skill constraints that inhibit technology adoption.

",2010-06-15,2014-05-23,"The first intervention tests the pervasive hypothesis that two types of informational market failures prevent the adoption of efficient technology: 1) asymmetric information between firms and service providers may deter adoption of efficient technologies, and 2) information about efficiency may be undersupplied in the market because it is a public good. The energy audit intervention overcomes these obstacles by providing information about energy efficiency, specific to each plant and free of cost.

The second intervention tests the relation between skilled labor and technology adoption. If plants are skill-constrained, then those provided energy managers should adopt a broader set of technologies and save more energy than those provided audits alone.","","The sample set is composed of 435 small and medium sized, textile and chemical industries in the industrial clusters of Ahmedabad, Ankleshwar and Surat in Gujarat, India.

The Impact of Packaging and Diagnosis on Adherence to Malaria Treatment in Uganda,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/490,"September 03, 2014",2014-09-03 12:04:24 -0400,AEARCTR-0000490,"Jessica Cohen, cohenj@hsph.harvard.edu",completed,2010-11-11,2011-09-26,"[""health"", """"]","I15, O12","The failure of patients to adhere to recommended treatment guidelines is a major driver of widespread pathogen resistance, making diseases like malaria, pneumonia and HIV increasingly difficult and expensive to treat. Currently, Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) are the only fully effective treatment remaining for malaria. Although ACTs have a short 3-day dosing regimen,  over 35 percent of patients do not complete the full course of drugs. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in central Uganda with 2,500 households, designed to understand the reasons for poor adherence to the ACT treatment regimen. We also experimented with specially designed packaging and targeted messages to boost adherence. We find that the strongest predictor of adherence is how the patient is feeling (their symptom severity) when they are halfway through the treatment course. We hypothesize that patients who feel better mid-course assume their malaria is cured and discontinue treatment. Consistent with this hypothesis, a sticker affixed to standard ACT packaging that informs people that “malaria is not gone until all tablets are finished” significantly (though modestly) increases adherence, particularly for those patients whose symptoms were resolving early. On the other hand, a message designed to discourage saving pills for future malaria episodes had no significant effect on adherence. We also test a common approach to increasing adherence to ACTs in Africa by using specialized packaging that includes pictorial instructions for illiterate patients, and information designed to raise patients' confidence in the effectiveness of the medication. While this special packaging increases the cost of ACTs by 10 to 50 percent, we find that it has no significant effect on medication-taking behavior or on comprehension of instructions.",2011-03-03,2011-08-18,"Our primary outcome is adherence, that is whether the patient completed all the recommended doses of the ACT drugs. 

We also look at the number of doses and tablets remaining as additional outcomes of the intervention. Some treatments arms may have an effect on the intensive margin of increasing the number of pills taken without affecting the level of adherence. This increase in the intensive margin is likely to still be beneficial both in treating the disease and in minimizing the likelihood of the development of resistance to the drugs by the pathogen. ","
","The study took place in the district of Luwero, Uganda, located in Uganda's central region, between November 2010 and September 2011. The study area constitutes catchment areas surrounding nine drug shops that were located in and around three small trading centers in the east of the district (Busiika, Zirobwe and Wabitungu).Surveys were conducted at four points through the study period: at baseline, at the time of ACT purchase, several days after ACT purchase (“follow up”) and at study endline. 

In November and December 2010, a team of enumerators traveled to each household in the study area to enroll participants and conduct a baseline survey. Households were then given a Purchase ID card, which enabled any of the household members to purchase ACTs at a 95 percent subsidy at any of the nine selected drug shops. 

The objective of the project was to assess the impact of various forms of packaging and messages associated with ACTs on adherence. To evaluate this, we randomized the type of packaging/messages households received each time they came to the participating shops to purchase ACTs. The treatment arms were randomly assigned at the shop-day level. That is, an ex-ante schedule was laid out using a random number generator that indicated that Shop 1 got package A on March 1, package B on March 2, and Shop 2 got package C on March 1, control pack on March 2, etc. Surveyors assigned to each shop brought the control or treatment packs for that particular day with them, and both the study team and shop owners were blinded to the treatment assignment until the day of sale.

During the time of the ACT purchase, a short survey was administered at the shop with the patient or with the caretaker if the patient was a young child. The survey primarily concerned the severity of the symptoms that the patient was currently experiencing. In addition, a subset of people were randomly offered a free rapid diagnosis test for malaria. In cases where the patient was not present at the drug shop, the field officer tested the patient at the household. 

Adherence was assessed through follow-up visits at the household roughly three days after the time of ACT purchase. 

At the end of the data collection period (in August and September 2011), field officers visited each of the participating households and informed participants the study was ending.

In addition, I am planning to construct emotionally-corrected scores of the aforementioned psychometric test (Grit, Locus Control, etc.). The idea is to correct the scores by the emotional state at baseline.

In particular, I use low-cost portable electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets to estimate subject’s emotional state following methodologies from emotion detection theory (See for example Takahashi, 2004; Ramirez and Vamvakousis, 2012; Verma and Tiwary, 2014). In fact, emotions will be modeled using the arousal-valence model developed by Lang (1995), in which arousal is related to activation and deactivation and valence is related to gratification and displeasure. I'll have particular focus on valence dimension, since it is theoretically unambiguously related with perception, having a positive relation with many psychometric test scores. 


","This study consists of eight randomly selected schools. The randomization considered only ""technical"" schools, i.e. vocational schools, as well as schools that belong to the 4th Region of Coquimbo in Chile, since they were eligible to receive the program.

The randomization was done by both the NGO that run the program an the main researcher of this project. ","The data analysis will follow the methodology developed by Ramirez and Vamvakousis (2012) to measure emotions from EEG signals. Evidence has shown that the prefrontal cortex coordinates consciousness and regulates emotions (Bear et al. 2007). In fact, to measure emotions it would be consider the EEG signal using electrodes AF3, AF4, F3, and F4 in the 10-20 standard classification, which are located on the prefrontal lobe (For the exact location of each electrode in the brain, see Figure 10 20 SYSTEM in the appendix.). By applying a Fourier transformation, it is possible to separate the EEG signal into different frequencies, from 1 to 80Hz. The frequencies of interest in measuring emotions are both alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) waves (Bos, 2011). Alpha waves are predominant in relaxed states and brain inactivation, while beta frequencies are associated with alertness and excited state of mind. Consequently, the beta-alpha ratio is an effective indicator of the level of arousal. On the other hand, previous neurophysiological evidence had shown that emotional valence has different representation in right and left brain's cortical hemisphere (see Ramirez and Vamvakousis, 2012). Right frontal inactivation is correlated with positive emotion, while left frontal inactivation is related with negative emotion. Since inactivation could be measured as the inverse of arousal level, it is possible to estimate valence level by subtracting the inverse of arousal on the left hemisphere with the the same index in the right hemisphere.",Randomization done in office by a computer.,The unit of randomization was the school.,"8 schools.

Design: A stratified randomized controlled study by region and gender. Computer generated random assignments allocated treatment and control groups.
Setting: Provider misconceptions and biases about contraceptive methods are major barriers to family planning access for women in low- and middle-income countries, including Jordan. Evidence-Based Medicine programs aim to reduce biases and misconceptions by providing doctors with the most up-to-date scientific evidence on contraceptive methods. Study was conducted December 2011 to January 2013. 
Participants: 267 private doctors providing family planning services in Amman and Zarqa regions in Jordan. 
Intervention: The treatment group was invited to attend a roundtable seminar on the injectable contraceptive DMPA, and to receive two 15 minute one-on-one educational visits that reinforce the messages from the seminar. The control group received two educational visits on the previous year's material on Combined Oral Contraception pills and no information on DMPA. 
Main outcome measures: Providers' knowledge of DMPA, attitudes towards DMPA, self-perceived confidence level, and reported clinical practice.
Results: 267 providers randomized (treatment group n= 135; control group n= 132). 38 providers excluded because they did not complete an endline survey leaving 229 doctors (treatment group n = 117 ; control group n = 112) for intention to treat analysis. No significant impact of the EBM program on knowledge of DMPA's side effects (point estimates -0.02) or on reported clinical practices (point estimates -0.01). Attitude and Confidence Scores of providers in the treatment group are 0.14 and 0.21 standard deviations higher (respectively) compared to the control group, but not statistically significant. Evidence shows positive selection into program participation.  
Conclusions: EBM may not be effective as a stand-alone program targeting a family planning method with a high level of provider and consumer bias. Evidence of positive selection into program participation underscores the importance of randomization to avoid overestimating the true effects of interventions.
",2012-01-15,2012-06-29,"Providers' knowledge of DMPA, attitudes towards DMPA, self-perceived confidence level, and reported clinical practice.","All outcome variables are defined as scores and constructed from main variables:  (1) providers' knowledge of DMPA (for example, correct identification of side effects), represented as their Knowledge Score; (2) providers' attitudes towards DMPA (including willingness to recommend DMPA), represented as their Attitude Score; (3) providers' self-perceived confidence level (including confidence in discussing DMPA with clients), represented as their Confidence Score; and (4) providers' reported clinical practice (such as reported prescription or discussion of DMPA with clients), represented as their Practice Score.  Each outcome measure is constructed as explained below. 

To measure knowledge and attitudes towards DMPA, the survey respondents were asked to rate specific knowledge and attitudes statements using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree."" Examples of these statements are: ""Use of DMPA is positively associated with weight gain""; or, ""I would have no hesitation recommending DMPA to a healthy woman. ""We assign values ranging from -2 to +2 to each of the knowledge and attitude variables, where +2 denotes the most desirable item response (e.g., ""I strongly agree"" that I would have no hesitation recommending DMPA to a healthy woman), and -2 denotes the least desirable response. We create a Knowledge Score and an Attitude Score for each provider using the simple average of related variables. Following Kling et al. (2007), we standardize the scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the variable among the EBM control group, such that the control group's mean is zero and its standard deviation is one. 

To measure self-perceived confidence in DMPA, the respondents were asked to provide answers to three questions, using a ten-point scale. Examples of these questions are: ""How knowledgeable do you feel about DMPA?"" and ""How comfortable do you feel prescribing DMPA for your clients?"" We form the simple average of these three variables and create a Confidence Score that we also standardize according to Kling et al. (2007). Confidence outcomes were not collected at baseline. 

To measure clinical practices related to DMPA, the respondents were asked to report whether they have any DMPA stock at their clinic, as well as the number of times they discussed DMPA with clients or prescribed it to their clients during the month prior to the survey. We form z-scores of each of these three variables, compute a Practice Score using the simple average, and then similarly apply Kling et al. (2007) to standardize the score among the control group.
","1. Determining the sample
From 2005 to 2010, the  USAID-funded predecessor project, Private Sector Project for Women's Health-Jordan, worked with private obstetricians/gynecologists and general practitioners who provide family planning services in Jordan. The project compiled a list of providers that the study team used as the sampling frame for this evaluation. The sample of eligible providers consisted of 267 private health providers in two regions, Amman and Zarqa. The sample did not include doctors practicing in the North and South regions of Jordan because it was logistically difficult to randomize those doctors and provide a widely dispersed treatment group with EBM seminars. About 16 percent of the doctors in the sample are specialists; the rest are general practitioners. 

2. Randomization 
Using STATA v.12, the sample of 267 providers was randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, stratifying by geographic area, gender, and on whether the providers belonged to the project's network of providers. In total, there were 135 providers in the treatment group and 132 in the control group. Random assignment was done prior to data collection and the results were not communicated to anyone outside of the research study team.

3. Baseline Data Collection 
A baseline survey was conducted in December 2011. Survey questionnaires were mailed to all 267 providers and follow-up phone calls were made to providers who did not respond to the mailed questionnaire. The questions asked for specific information on the provider’s knowledge of DMPA's side effects, attitudes towards the method, and clinical practices such as discussing DMPA with clients or prescribing it. 

4. DMPA EBM Intervention 
Treatment group providers were invited to a two-hour roundtable seminar and received two 15 minute educational visits that would reinforce messages from the seminar.

5. Endline Data Collection 
The endline survey conducted in December 2012 collected information similar to the baseline: provider knowledge of DMPA's side effects, attitudes towards the method, and practices. It also collected information such as years of experience, number of patients seen, whether the provider has a dual practice, and the types of family planning methods that the provider has prescribed. Enumerators conducted in-office surveys. Primarily due to the change in the data collection method, the endline response rate was higher than the baseline rate- 87 percent (229 providers).

Participants will be given an assortment of homogeneous cognitive tasks with arbitrary point values subject to a randomized time limit. Their optimizing behavior will be a function of the order in which they choose to complete the tasks and this will be analyzed across assigned time limits to assess the impact of time scarcity. 

The project will examine both static (choice between anticipated tasks) and dynamic (choice between anticipated and unanticipated tasks) optimization by randomly selecting participants to receive additional “interruption” tasks during the experiment. Since optimization is in itself a cognitive task and previous studies have demonstrated cognitive function declines as scarcity intensifies, the expected outcome will show an individual's propensity to optimize declines as their time constraint tightens, resulting in inefficient use of time and suboptimal outcomes. 

The project will build on recent analyses of poverty and the scarcity mindset, contributing lack of optimization as an additional mechanism by which scarcity perpetuates poverty.",2015-02-15,2015-12-31,"Through this experiment, we hope to demonstrate that as the scarcity of a resource intensifies, the propensity of an individual to use that resource optimally decreases, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Optimizing in itself is a cognitive task that carries a cost; for any set of options, there is a nonzero cost to weighing each option's marginal benefit against its marginal cost and comparing this measure across options to choose the best. The burden of scarcity makes this process more difficult, through both its negative impact on cognitive function and the increased weight of the fixed cost of optimizing relative to the budget constraint. This provides an explanation for why a highly constrained individual may not behave rationally, especially in contexts where the marginal benefit of any particular option is unclear or difficult to measure, such as the returns to education. If the consequences of suboptimal choice are severe enough, such an individual may be ensnared in a “poverty trap.”","","To assess individuals’ optimizing behavior under time scarcity, we administer a randomized control trial in which study participants are given an assortment of homogeneous cognitive tasks to complete subject to a randomized time constraint. The range of time constraints are selected so that it is impossible to complete all tasks within the time limit to simulate varying degrees of scarcity. These tasks will be assigned arbitrary point values to simulate heterogeneous marginal benefits, and these point values will be selected so that the tasks can be clearly ranked (i.e., completing one task is strictly preferred to completing another task in all foreseeable cases). To capture the ability to optimize independently, we partially obscure these points through their placement on each page.","Within the scope of this study, we define “optimizing” as starting with the task assigned the highest point value and completing successive tasks in descending order of points, ending with the task assigned the lowest point value. Given that the tasks are of homogeneous difficulty and the tasks can be clearly ranked, we believe this definition is consistent with economic theory. We define the “optimal score ratio” as the participant's total points attained divided by the score they would have attained had they optimized; higher values (approaching the maximum value of 1) indicate a higher level of optimization.

We examine both static (choosing between anticipated tasks) and dynamic (choosing between anticipated and unanticipated tasks) optimization by randomly selecting some participants to receive additional “interruption” tasks during the experiment. These interruptions will have all the same characteristics as the original tasks except for anticipation, allowing us to isolate dynamic optimization. To measure the effect of information, we will also randomly select some participants to receive an additional instruction telling them ahead of time that tasks yield different point values. This simulates reducing the fixed cost of optimization by calling attention to the measure of marginal benefit.

At the end of each session, participants are given a short survey, asking for basic demographic information (e.g. age, gender). We also ask questions about their approach to the tasks in order to compare actual optimization to participants' perception.

The market for improved sanitation services (mechanized desludging in particular) is important:  sanitation services have high externalities for the local communities. A government may want to intervene in the market for sanitation services but find it difficult to do so as they are unable to observe values for the consumers or costs for the service providers.  

In a first round survey, we measured the underlying values of services for customers and the cost of providing services for desludging operators.  We used this information to design two pricing treatment structures, one with fixed prices set based on household characteristics, and another with desludger bidding and negotiations with desludgers for lower prices.  The fixed prices are set based on household characteristics; this treatment is designed to allow governments to target subsidies to poor households while financing some of the subsidies through price discrimination toward wealthier households. We will test whether these pricing structures, developed based on the underlying factors in the economy, perform better than the control group which has no pricing intervention in terms of total take-up of mechanized desludging.  This project will describe and test how information on market structure can be used to help in designing interventions by governments to improve the market structure of sanitation services.",2015-07-25,2016-08-31,"takeup of mechanical desludging, takeup of mechanical desludging among heterogeneous consumer groups, mechanical desludging prices offered by suppliers ","","In many peri-urban communities in developing countries (like Ouagadougou), the market for sanitation services (especially mechanical desludging) is under-developed, and households often resort to using inferior (manual desludging) methods.

In Burkina Faso, we use measures of the underlying values for improved desludging services from a survey run in December, 2014, and second-price auctions for the procurement of desludging services run from December 2014 through July 2015 to develop a model of the optimal tariffs to charge each household for desludging services in order to increase take-up as much as possible given a constrained budget for subsidies.

We test the modeled “ideal” prices against two options:  first, a pure control group of households which are offered no pricing intervention, and second, a group of households that are asked to call into the call center for a desludging when they need one, and are given the lowest cost desludger that the call center is able to find through a bid-undercutting mechanism.

The endline survey will be rolled out after the randomized price structures have been in effect for 12 months. At this point, we expect the median household to have used 2 desludgings since the roll out of the price structures, and we will be able to observe the relative impact of the different price structures, estimate demand for sanitation services, and estimate the impact of the monitoring interventions.  ","Pricing Model Intervention: The characteristics of the model for the optimal pricing structure of desludging services are as shown in the attached Market Design Appendix.  
Undercutting-bid intervention: The undercutting-bid mechanism is meant to instigate competition among desludgers while maintaining a group of desludgers who are willing to provide desludging services to the household at short notice. We ran second-price auctions for the procurement of desludging services from December 2014-July 2015.  We are continuing these auctions for the procurement of desludging services to be used for our pricing model treatment.  In order to encourage increased competition while offering services to households that call in as quickly as possible, we generate a spot-price setting mechanism.  The spot price will be derived from calling desludgers and offering them the job for a slightly lower price than those bid in the second price auctions.  ",Randomization done by computer,Neighborhood clusters of 30-40 households,126,"3,750","1,550 in the price structure intervention, 1000 in the bid-undercutting treatment, and 1,200 control","Please see page 13 of the Market Design Appendix for power size calculations and expected effect size of the price structure treatment.  

For the under-cutting bid treatment, we expect prices to go down by approximately 1,000 CFA.  This is based on the bidding in the second price auctions, together with the fact that the bidders will be encouraged to reduce their prices through the price-undercutting mechanism.  With an effect size of 1,000 CFA, a standard deviation of 5964, and a sample mean of 16,836, this means that the necessary sample size is 282.  We multiply the sample size by 1.9 since the intra-cluster correlation coefficient is 0.03 and clusters have approximately 30 households in order to be conservative (decisions are made at the household, not cluster level). This gives us a sample size requirement of 535 households.

We expect this price reduction of 1,000 CFA on average to increase take-up of mechanical desludging by  0.085 from 0.455 to .555 (.455 was the mean in our data from an earlier survey sampled from the same areas).  Our data from the prior survey shows that the standard deviation for take-up is 0.49.  This means that for power of .8 on take-up, we need a sample size of 197 (To be conservative, we increase the sample by a multiple of 3 because sampling is by neighborhood-cluster of 25-35 households.  However, these clusters are used for logistical ease.  Decisions are made at the household level, and we do not expect high intra-cluster correlation—intracluster correlation in an earlier survey was calculated as .07.  With clusters of size 30, this generates an inflation factor of 3).  

On average about 50% of households get a desludging over the course of a year, with 50% of those who get at least one desludging getting 2 or more desludgings in a year.  We sample 1000 households with the offer of the negotiation treatment in order to get an expected 500 households offered the treatment and actually needing a desludging over the course of the year (with over 1000 desludgings total expected among those households over the year).

The vocational training voucher program selected applicants by lottery to receive vouchers which permitted them to enroll in training programs of their own choosing between 2009 and 2010. The cash grant program was launched in mid-2013, and provided grants to a randomly selected subset of voucher winners and non-winners.

The TVVP is a randomized evaluation of a youth training intervention in Kenya. In 2008, participants of an ongoing longitudinal data collection effort known as the Kenyan Life Panel Survey (KLPS) were invited by a local non-governmental organization to apply to receive a voucher to cover the cost of vocational training.  2,163 young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 submitted an application, and a randomly selected half of applicants (1,055 individuals) were awarded a voucher while the other half served as the comparison group. Furthermore, a random half of all TVVP introductory meetings included an additional intervention – a presentation on the returns to vocational training, highlighting in particular the opportunity for women to learn traditionally male-dominated trades, which in many cases are more lucrative. We refer to this as the “information intervention”. 

TVVP voucher winners subsequently enrolled in training for varying lengths of time during 2009-2011 at any of 65 different public and private training institutions in rural and urban locations across Kenya. Data was collected from participating individuals and training institutions during the enrollment period, and near term follow-up data was collected from TVVP program applicants between August 2011 and August 2014.

In 2013, the SCY program was launched utilizing this same sample of individuals, such that a randomly selected half of TVVP voucher winners and half of non-winners were awarded unconditional cash grants worth approximately US$230 each. Upon enrollment in the program but prior to the receipt of the grant, grant winners were given pamphlets with tips on starting and running a business, in an effort to encourage use of the grants for investment in entrepreneurship.","","The randomization for the SCY program was done using STATA software, stratifying by gender, baseline participation in the Primary School Deworming Project or the Girls' Scholarship Program (and assignment to treatment group in the respective program), assignment to TVVP voucher and information intervention groups, and survey wave.",SCY grants were randomized at the individual level.,"2,163 individuals","2,163 individuals","950 grant winners, and 1,213 non-winners

All respondents received a free mobile phone to enable follow-up polling by phone.

In each of 100 randomly selected survey clusters, 7 of 10 respondents were invited to view a documentary video presenting pros and cons of various gas policy options (the information treatment).  Of the respondents who were invited to the information treatment, 4 individuals were invited to a democratic deliberation about the use of the natural gas.

Follow-up polling will measure the medium term (i.e., weeks rather than hours after treatment) impact of information and deliberation on respondents' knowledge and policy preferences.  Follow-up polling will be conducted by phone and broken into multiple rounds, due to limitations on respondents' attention span on the phone.
","",Both clusters and individuals were randomly assigned to treatment arms by one of the PIs on a computer in the office using Stata.,"1. Cluster level randomization: The survey spans 200 primary sampling units (PSUs).  We use the terms cluster and PSU interchangeably here.  Of these 100 clusters, individuals chosen to participate in the information and deliberation treatments will be drawn exclusively from 100 treatment clusters.  In rural areas, clusters are defined as a sub-village or hamlet (kitongoji).  In urban areas, clusters are defined as a block or sub-ward (mtaa).  Ten individual poll respondents were sampled from each PSU.

(For the information treatment, this will include 7 of 10 individuals in each treatment cluster.  For the deliberation treatment, this will include 4 of 10 individuals in each treatment cluster, a strict subset of the information treatment group.) 

3. Random formation of deliberative groups.  The 400 individuals to be invited to the deliberative event will be assigned to small groups to deliberate on policy options. Assuming perfect compliance (i.e., all invitees attend the event), participants will be assigned to 25 groups of 16 people.  The event will span four rounds of deliberation. Groups will be randomly reassigned for each of the four rounds.  The random assignment of moderators to deliberative groups is implicit in this design.","200 primary sampling units (sub-villages or ""vitongoji"" in rural areas; blocks or ""mitaa"" in urban areas)","2,000 individuals","Pure control clusters = 100
Treatment clusters = 100

Within treatment clusters:
Information treatment = 700 individuals, 7 per treatment cluster
Deliberation treatment = 400 individuals, 4 per treatment cluster (subset of info treatment arm)
Control group within treatment clusters = 300 individuals, 3 per treatment cluster
","We present the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for each treatment arm on a hypothetical measure of public opinion.  We calculate the MDE for two parameters:
1.     The intent-to-treat effect of deliberation plus information.
2.     The intent-to-treat effect of information alone.

Our design is intended to measure spillover effects (i.e., information flows) within clusters, and we focus here on the MDE for treatment effects that are not contaminated by spillovers, comparing individuals invited to treatment with control individuals in pure control villages.

We calculate MDEs based on a power (κ) of 80% and a significance level (α) of 5%. 

A key unknown parameter is the intraclass correlation of responses within our clusters.  We estimate this correlation using data from Tanzania’s National Panel Survey (NPS), rounds 1 and 2.  The NPS is uniquely suited to our purposes here, in that it (a) has a clustered sample design, (b) collects information on public opinion, in this case support for the respondent’s member of parliament, and (c) follows the same respondent over time to enable us to calculate variances and intraclass correlations in terms of both levels and changes.  Using the NPS data, we conducted power calculations using a variety of possible outcome measures: MDEs in terms of a binary response variable, and levels and changes of both variables.  Both variables show an intraclass correlation of approximately 0.16.  All calculations below use this parameter value as a conservative estimate of our anticipated MDE.

Because the experimental design proposed above involves unequal divisions of individuals between treatment and control groups (and between various treatment arms), we calculate MDEs by simulation in Stata based on randomly generated numbers with the intraclass correlation found in the NPS and the sample design described above. Each repetition of the simulation produces slightly different standard errors and thus MDEs. We repeated the simulation 20 times and averaged the MDEs over all iterations.

Condition on 80,000 participants that satisfy these criteria, we randomly assign them into seven test groups.

Evidence on the welfare benefits of electricity access is critical for devising rational energy and climate policies. At the same time, the electricity sectors in developing countries are woefully inefficient, and their rapid growth will not be sustainable if it relies on burning ever more fossil fuels. Small, decentralized energy projects will therefore play an important role in providing universal access and may reduce the carbon-intensity of electricity load growth. 

The experimental design will offer solar micro-grid connections to households in areas with limited or no electricity access in rural North-West Bihar.  The experiment allots 100 sample villages into one of three experimental treatment arms: solar micro-grid service at the prevailing price of INR 200 per month, solar micro-grid service at a subsidized price of INR 100 per month, and a control arm with no offer of service.  There are two main research aims.  First, by making offers of electricity service at different prices and measuring take-up, to measure how much people value solar electricity.  The value of solar will be compared to substitute energy sources such as decentralized electricity generated with diesel fuel.  Second, by collecting data on economic and social outcomes, to compare newly connected villages to those without electricity and estimate the welfare benefits of access to electricity for poor rural households.  Economic and social outcomes include electricity access, energy expenditures, time use and income, as well as potential indirect benefits of electricity use such as reading comprehension and informedness through information technology.

The survey has twelve modules covering demography, education, health, livelihood patterns, electricity usage, household income, mobile phone usage for business activity, and expenditure and willingness to pay for electricity.  

In that experimental sample, villages will then be assigned with equal probability to one of three treatment conditions:

 Does Exposure to Ethnic Minorities Affect Support for Welfare Dualism?

The core assumptions of this perspective are that people will develop social group identifications where ethnic similarities typically function as group boundaries. Negative views
on out-group members are caused by real or perceived competition between your in-group and out-groups over scarce resources such as rights and social status (see e.g. Bobo 1999; Semyonov, Raijman, and Gorodzeisky 2006).

The core assumptions and implications of conflict theory stand in stark contrast to those of the competing inter-group contact theory (see e.g. Pettigrew 1998). According to this perspective, prejudice and negative stereotyping of minorities might decline with contact with out-group members. Since the frequency of contact will increase with ethnic diversity, any negative effects of immigration on welfare state support caused by increased competition over resources might be o_-set by the positive consequences of increased contact with members of the minority group. While inter-group contact theory is frequently used to debunk the bleak perspective of conflict theory, it is often forgotten that contact theory proposes quite restrictive conditions for in what contexts contact will reduce majority-minority conflict: Contact will reduce tensions only if those in contact have equal status in the particular context, if they share common goals, if they are in a cooperative context, and if the contact takes place under some form of authority (see Pettigrew 1998).

The existing empirical literature on the consequences of ethnic diversity tends to overlook how important these different underlying assumptions are, and simply regress e.g. some indicator of views on diversity on an indicator of ethnic diversity (e.g. Senik, Stichnoth, and Van der Straeten 2009). The discrepancy between the theoretical and empirical model implies that the empirical estimates are not very informative about the importance of minority-majority contact. We take the underlying assumptions of contact theory more seriously than in the previous literature and test it in a setting where theory suggests it is most likely to hold. We also set up a research design with a random allocation to give our estimates a causal interpretation.

Specifically, we propose an explicit test of contact theory in a context where the strict assumptions of the theory is plausible, namely in the military. In fact, the initial inspiration and empirical support for contact theory is from a study of integration of Black soldiers into the US Army (see Pettigrew 1998). Soldiers of private rank have equal social status within the army, they share the common goals of the unit, they need to cooperate to solve their tasks, and contact takes place in a context with an explicit, enforcing authority. Moreover, the army is a promising venue to study social interaction since the soldiers cannot determine who they want to share rooms with and who they want to serve with. Thus, biases due to self-selection into social interactions based on own preferences (such as prejudice) are reduced, and we have exogenous exposure to contact with out-group members.

This paper takes a different tack: can managerial practices explain this variation in productivity? A randomized evaluation of the introduction of a mobile phone-based agricultural consulting service, Avaaj Otalo (AO), to farmers in Gujarat, India, reveals the following. Demand for agricultural advice is substantial and farmers offered the service turn less often to traditional sources of agricultural advice. Management practices change as well: farmers invest more in recommended agricultural inputs resulting in dramatic increases in yield for cumin (26.3%), and improvements in cotton yield (3.5%) for a sub-group that received frequent reminders to use the service. Peers of treated farmers also change their information sources and cropping decisions, albeit to a much smaller extent. Farmers appear willing to follow advice without understanding why it is correct: we do not observe gains in agricultural knowledge. We estimate that each dollar invested in AO generates a return of $10. These findings highlight the importance of managerial practices in facilitating technology adoption in agriculture.

Prior to the start of the intervention, farmers participated in a household survey which covered major topics including key agricultural and demographic variables, and also tested their knowledge about basic agricultural information. Following the intervention which provided farmers with relevant agricultural information and answered any questions they might have, farmers were again tested on the same agricultural questions to see if the intervention had impacted their agricultural knowledge. Similarly, the paper surveys collected information on agricultural inputs used to gauge if there was a change in agricultural practices following the intervention.  Farmers were also asked to identify which sources of agricultural information they rely on the most, and how much trust they place in these sources. We also collect information on crop yield, revenue and annual income to see if the use of mobile-phone based agricultural information leads to better agricultural outcomes for farmers.","With the help of our partner organization – Development Support Center (DSC), we identified 1200 farmers that grow cotton and own a mobile phone.

Competition and Cooperation in Small Firm Networks: Evidence from garment makers in Ghana ,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/642,"March 05, 2015",2015-03-05 01:31:43 -0500,AEARCTR-0000642,"Morgan Hardy, mlhardy@gmail.com",on_going,2014-02-01,2016-06-01,"[""finance"", ""governance"", ""labor"", ""welfare"", """"]","","Empirical research on firm-level network connections in developing countries has focused to date primarily on agricultural technology adoption. Several influential papers document that in the context of agricultural commodities, social networks can be leveraged to increase technology adoption, agricultural yields, and ultimately incomes (e.g. Bandiera and Rasul, 2006, Conley and Udry, 2010, Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995). 

Transferring these findings to other income generating contexts is complicated by the fact that many manufacturing and services firms compete more directly over local demand (which is essentially fixed in the short term) than communities of agricultural producers compete given a wider market or world price. This direct competition puts potentially profit increasing functions of firm-level networks in conflict with co-insurance functions of firm-level networks. As Barr (1998) observes, networks maintained primarily to address uncertainty and income variability generate greater positive spillover effects, but limit the potential for network connections to improve firm performance. The co-insurance motive may also actually limit competitiveness within a network, as firm owners prefer to maintain co-insurance relationships rather than aggressively compete and alienate potential risk sharing partners. 

Small and micro enterprise owners in Ghana, and throughout the developing world, maintain complex network relationships within their industries. Our sample, the universe of garment making firm owners in a single mid-size town in the Volta Region of Ghana, is no exception. Baseline data reveals patterns of skill sharing, information sharing, productive input sharing, and outsourcing that suggest these firm-level networks serve an important co-insurance function. 

In this experiment, a random subset of our sample will receive training in a new fashion style. Training will include a technical component, discussion of marketing the new style, and marketing materials. Leveraging baseline heterogeneity in the number and nature of network connections, in combination with the randomized experiment, we seek to characterize the nature of network relationships in our context and measure the effects of different types of relationships on firm performance. 

Ex-ante, the overall predictions are ambiguous, but broadly we hypothesize that we will observe both positive direct effects of training on income and positive indirect/spillover effects of training on the income of trained firms' network connections. In addition, we expect these positive spillover effects to be strongest (1) for network connections with a history of skill sharing, (2) in the later weeks of the follow-up panel, and (3) for competition-distant network connections. In addition, we hope to document negative spillover/competition effects of training on firms that are close competitors of trained firms but not co-insurance network connections. Documenting the dynamic ability of trained firms to capitalize on any competitive advantage associated with the new style in the early period, and whether/how that competitive advantage dissipates due to co-insurance skill-sharing norms is a key ambition of this study. 

Focus groups and qualitative interviews before the design of the experiment revealed that skill-seeking behavior may be an important skill diffusion channel, as the norm among skill-sharing partners requires positive response to requests for skill-sharing but not proactive/preemptive skill-sharing. Consequently, the experiment will also randomize a subset of the sample to receive information and marketing material about the fashion style, but not direct technical training. We expect these firm owners to seek technical instruction from skill-sharing network connections. More skill-sharing to informed (but not trained) firms would be evidence that the co-insurance mechanism functions imperfectly, where the ability to hide a new competitive advantage allows firm owners to retain that advantage longer.

Tax filers in the non-commitment group make an on-the-spot savings decision at the tax site (e.g. in February), in response to variation in incentives paid either immediately (e.g. in February) or at a delayed time (e.g. in October). We use the outcomes in this group to inform us about the discount between the present and a future period. This group was contacted in December 2010. First, they received a notice in the mail, from the Financial Clinic, informing them that we would be calling them to explain a savings opportunity. Importantly, the mailing included information briefly summarizing the key, treatment group-specific, incentives.28	We then followed up the initial mailing with phone outreach to enroll the tax filer in the study. During the call, survey data on demographic characteristics and financial behavior were collected, and the participant was also asked to consider a matched savings account: the SaveUp Account. Participants were informed that if they return to The Financial Clinic tax preparation site to file their taxes, they would have the opportunity to open the SaveUp Account. In order to obtain the match, the tax filer must keep her savings amount in an illiquid account for 8 months (that is until October 2011). In return for allocating at least $300 to this account, the tax filer would receive a 50% match for each dollar saved between $300 and $1,050.29 Participants who only received this information comprise the non-commitment control arm
(group 1). The incentives for this control arm are represented graphically in Figure A.2. Within the set of non-commitment arms, there are two treatment arms who are additionally offered either an “immediate” incentive of $50 (group 2), given at the time of filing taxes, or a “delayed” incen- tive of $50 received after the 8 month saving period (group 3), in return for saving. A graphical representation of the incentives for members in these two treatment arms is provided in Figures A.3 and A.4.30
When participants in these three arms arrived to file their tax returns during the following tax season — February through April — they were presented with the opportunity to open a SaveUp account, featuring the savings incentives described above. The Financial Clinic is able to open the savings account with money from the income tax refund, via a direct deposit option on the income tax return. If an account is opened, the funds cannot be withdrawn for 8 months, at which point all savings matches are credited to the account. Members of treatment arm 2 who open an account receive their “immediate” incentive when making the initial deposit (see Figure A.3), while members of treatment arm 3 receive the “delayed” incentive 8 months after opening the account (see Figure A.4). Additional survey data, similar to that collected over the phone, was collected at the tax site.
Concretely, a member of the non-commitment control group had the opportunity to receive up to $375 in saving incentives if they chose to save $1,050. A member of the non-commitment treatment groups could have received up to $425 in saving incentives — which includes an extra $50 incentive over the control arm for saving.
2.3.2	Commitment Group
Participants in the commitment group made two decisions. Their first, soft-commitment decision was made prior to the tax season (e.g. December) in response to incentives paid earlier in the future (e.g. February) or later in the future (e.g. October). We use this first set of decisions to learn about the discount between two future payments, one further in the future than the other. Commitment group members also made a final savings decision at the tax site. This group was similarly contacted during the December preceding the tax filing season with a mail notice followed by phone outreach. In the mailing and over the phone they were provided with the relevant information for their experimental arms.31	Members of the commitment group were given surveys and informed of a saving opportunity, the SaveUpFront Account, in a similar fashion to members of the non-commitment groups.
In contrast to members of the non-commitment group, commitment group members were asked in December to make a soft-commitment regarding a savings account. Importantly, they either had the option of soft-committing to save or soft-committing to not save. The SaveUpFront account is similar to SaveUp Account, with a minimum deposit of $300, and a 50% match on every additional dollar deposited up until $950.32	The commitment was “soft” in that the ultimate savings deci- sion could deviate from the commitment. However, the soft-commitment still mattered for future incentives. If the tax filer softly committed to saving, the savings account would include an addi- tional $100 in savings incentives conditional on saving at least $300. Alternatively, if the tax filer soft-committed to not saving, she still had the option to save at the tax site, but now would receive a $75 payment in October should she not have saved. Thus, the commitment reinforced decisions in either direction, and therefore can be distinguished from “cheap talk.” Participants who only received this treatment comprised the commitment control arm (group 4). The incentives for this arm are illustrated in Figure A.5.
The remaining members of the two commitment treatment arms were offered an additional incentive for soft-committing to save. For soft-committing to save, the individual received a $50 incentive — either an “early” incentive, given at the time of filing taxes (group 5), or a “late” one received 8 months after the tax season (group 6). Importantly, the incentive was kept regardless of the final savings outcome — a key difference from the incentives for the non-commitment group. As will be explained below in Section 5, linking this incentive to the commitment decision, but keeping it independent of the final saving decision is key for separately identifying the discount parameters in a quasi-hyperbolic discounting model. The incentives for the two commitment treatment arms are illustrated in Figures A.6 and A.7.
At the time of tax preparation, members of the commitment group were reminded of their prior soft-commitment. They were also reminded of the features of the SaveUpFront Account, which depended on the previous, soft-commitment decision as demonstrated in Figures A.5–A.7. They then could make a final savings decision, which, importantly, could differ from their soft- commitment. There was, however, a penalty for deviating, i.e. the forgone commitment reward. The SaveUPFront Accounts were similarly funded via direct deposit from the income tax refund and had a similar maturity horizon of 8 months. Additional survey data was likewise collected from members of the commitment treatment groups when taxes were filed.
A member of the commitment control arm had the opportunity to receive up to $425 in saving and commitment incentives — $100 for following through on a soft-commitment to save and $325 for saving the maximum of $950. A member of the commitment treatment arms could receive up to $475 in incentives — which includes an extra $50 over the control arm just for having soft-committed to saving.","",Randomization done in office by computer.,Individual level,N/A,833,"137 in T1, 139 in T2, 140 in T3, 137 in T4, 140 in T5, 140 in T6","N/A.

Educational entertainment (“edutainment”) is a communication strategy that works through mass entertainment media with the aim of promoting a better context for behavior change than the delivery of information alone.  

This evaluation uses an experimental design to study the impact of MTV series Shuga, a TV drama targeted at youth that aims to change social norms and behavior related to high-risk sexual behavior and gender-based violence. The impact evaluation will be among the first to experimentally estimate the impact of a product similar to commercial TV series (as opposed to an educational movie). It will be the first time that two crucial aspects of edutainment programs are evaluated: i) their “spillover” effect on people who did not watch the drama but may have heard about it from friends and ii) their effect through viewers’ perceptions of the beliefs and values of their peers after watching the drama.  For instance, young men may only be willing to treat their partners with respect when they think that this will not make them look weak in the eyes of other men.  

The evaluation will employ a clustered randomized trial design where communities will be randomly assigned to treatment 1 (Shuga screenings only), treatment 2 (Shuga screenings plus information about attitudes of peers) and control groups. The Friends treatment is cross-cutting across the treatment arms and will be randomized at the individual level.

Secondary:
- Spillovers: Spillovers to friends who did not watch Shuga
","","The intervention will take place in screening centers, e.g.. schools or community centers.  Using GPS coordinates of screening centers, we define communities around each of these centres as households located within a 2 mile radius, ensuring that there are buffer zones between communities to minimize the risk of contamination across study groups.  These communities will constitute our unit of randomization. 

Treatment communities will constitute 2/3 of the sample, control communities 1/3 of the sample. In treatment communities individuals will be shown the Shuga TV drama in two screenings of four 20 minutes episodes each.  Control communities will be shown a placebo movie that will lack messages of sexual risky behavior and last for a similar amount of time. 
Treatment communities will be randomly divided into two arms: one arm will only show Shuga (Treatment 1); the second arm will show Shuga plus some reinforcing messages on other people's attitudes (Treatment 2).

To half of the treated individuals (both in Treatments 1 and 2) randomly selected, we will offer the option to bring up to two people to the screening. This treatment is randomized at the individual level and is cross-cutting across the other two treatments. We denote this as the “Friends treatment”. 

In all locations (treatment and control) survey participants who are NOT in the “Friends” treatment will be asked to list up to 3 friends whom they regularly talk to and who live in the community .

The basic treatment (Treatment 1) and control will not involve any other activity after the screening, to make the experience more comparable to that of a viewer who watches TV at home.

In half of the treatment communities (Treatment 2), the Shuga screenings will be followed by video-clips containing information on beliefs and values of peers in other communities after watching the Shuga drama.  These video-clips will include interviews of youth condemning negative behaviors and praising positive behaviors after watching the Shuga drama, together with smart graphs containing statistics on other young people's opinions on salient issues.

Taking into consideration budget limitations and the need to maximize MDE, we concluded that the optimal cluster size would be 63.

Our project will also have access to data from a related study that collects auction data from a call center that matches clients and desludgers. We will observe if callers accepted or rejected the auction winner's price for different bids.

Health outcomes will be measured using diarrhea rates through baseline and endline survey data, as compared to incidence of cold or cough symptoms. Sanitation will affect diarrhea rates, while respiratory problems (cold/cough) should see no effect.

Follow-through rate is important as realized take up is key to understanding the true effect of the treatment on willingness to pay.  We will compare the commitment to take up the improved sanitation service and the realized take up at the end of the study.    
","We use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate social effects on the adoption of mechanized desludging. First, we will offer randomly selected neighborhoods subsidized desludging services coupled with various social pressure treatments to measure direct social effects. 

We will construct 400 groups of twelve neighboring households each. These neighborhoods will be far enough apart that, in general, their sanitation decisions will not affect one another and the households will not know one another. In our 400 selected neighborhoods, each neighborhood will include 10 randomly chosen treated households and 2 untreated households; these 2 untreated households will allow us to measure indirect spillovers. 

We will first conduct a baseline survey of demographic information, including household composition, education, health, membership and participation in associations and cooperatives, and savings habits. We will also collect GPS data on the locations of the households.

We then conduct a second survey on willingness to pay for improved sanitation with the household member who is in charge of making decisions regarding desludging (""the decider""). The decider survey will cover savings and loans, wealth and durable assets, brief questions on income and spending, sanitation practices, and social networks. The social network component of the survey will include questions asking who in their neighborhood they talk with about waste disposal, who they would choose to lead a neighborhood sensitization on health, who is a member of the same association or cooperative as them, from whom they would borrow or to whom they would lend money, who they did borrow from or lend to within the past year, with whom they are related, which households use mechanized desludging, and where each household dumps its sludge. 

At the time of the second survey, in the 10 treatment households, we will offer the decider his randomly assigned treatment.  There are several treatment arms (please see experimental design) but one main treatment involves randomizing discounts of different sizes to households that sign up for a subscription of two desludgings, and randomizing whether this discount is private or public information.

At the end of the decider survey, households in the ""deposit"" group which would like to sign up for the subscription will be asked to pay a deposit of roughly US$6 – an amount equal to the respondent's participation gift. The deposit will be credited towards the second desludging, and will be unavailable to them until the end of the nine-month subsidy period. After the subsidy period ends, they will have the option to continue using the subscription for an unsubsidized third desludging depending on the interest of the Senegalese Ministry of Sanitation in continuing the program following the main research period. 

After the year in which treated households have access to subsidized desludgings, we will re-interview both the 4000 treated households and the 800 untreated households, allowing us to measure their sanitation practices and relationships with neighbors.","We will work in the Pikine and Guediawaye departments of peri-urban Dakar, Senegal. This area is home to approximately 1.2 million individuals, and roughly 80% of households in the area are not connected to the city's sewage network; each household is responsible for deciding how to dispose of its own waste. This area is also poorer than the rest of Dakar. Many areas in  Pikine and Guediawaye are far from the waste treatment plants or less directly accessible, so mechanized desludging is expensive. Collusion among desludging service providers also seems to contribute to high prices. These facts mean that adoption of mechanized desludging is particularly low relative to the rest of Dakar. We will measure the following direct social effects on the treated households. 

Social pressure and incoming reciprocity: We have randomly assigned discounts of 4% or 32% to each household, sharing the distribution of these discounts with 'public' clusters and not sharing this information in 'private' clusters. Households that have been assigned the high discount in 'public' clusters will face stronger social pressure to purchase the sanitation service than households that have been assigned the same discount in the ‘private’  clusters. We offer only two levels of subsidies in order to increase the social pressure felt by households drawing the high subsidy and in order to avoid small sample problems when estimating the impact of the subsidies.

The public-private treatment is randomized at the cluster level. There are 400 clusters, each with 10 households. In this treatment we will compare the overall use of mechanized desludging versus manual desludging. We estimate the necessary sample size assuming a standardized effect size of 0.2 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.2, based on desludging data from a related study in Dakar. With 10 households per cluster, the cluster-corrected power calculation suggests that we need at least 364 clusters. This corresponds to a power level of 95% and confidence level of 5%. We have selected 400 project clusters.

We will also evaluate the effect of this treatment on the follow-through rate for those who commit to mechanized desludging. Because this outcome can only be measured for participants who sign up for a subsidized desludging through the project, there will be fewer participants per cluster. We adjust the power calculation assuming only 4 households per cluster. We expect a greater standardized effect size for this group of 0.25. Keeping the same power and confidence levels, we need at least 333 clusters. 

Learning-by-Doing: People may be more likely to continue mechanized desludging after they experience it. Households are given discounts for the first two desludgings during the 9 months following their subscription, while the price for the third desludging, or any desludging after the 9-month period, will no longer be subsidized. 

Learning-from-others, coordination, and outgoing reciprocity: People may be more likely to sign up for mechanized desludging after they have seen their neighbors do it. Some of the neighborhoods (200 clusters of 10 households) will be randomly divided into two halves when surveying. In the second half, we will provide information about the first five households' desludging decisions to the last five participants. We will notify the last five of how many of their first five neighbors have signed up for a desludging subscription, with half of the treated group learning only the number of neighbors and half also learning the names of subscribing neighbors. We will then compare the takeup and follow-through rates of the first fives with the last fives, and also of the number-only treatment group with the names treatment group. 

Within a cluster, the assignment of households to the first five or last five is randomized at the individual level. In order to detect a standardized effect size of 0.2 for the learning from others treatment, we will need a sample size of at least 1300 households for a 5% confidence level with 95% power. Conducting this experiment with 2000 households is therefore sufficient. We will be able to compare the 1000 last five households with control groups from the 1000 first five households, as well as with the 2000 households not included in this experiment, giving a total of 1000 treated and 3000 control.

We will also compare the two treated groups – whether the households are told how many or who among their neighbors sign up for a mechanized desludging. These treatments are randomized at the cluster level, with 5 treated households per cluster. Because this intervention is logistically difficult and costly, we are not able to increase the sample beyond 100 clusters (500 households) per treatment arm. Still, this sample size will be sufficient to detect a standardized effect of 0.25 with 82% power, or a standardized effect of 0.3 with 94% power.

Incoming reciprocity: People may sign up for desludging in order to reap future benefits from their reciprocal neighbors. We will carry out baseline and endline social network surveys to test this. In addition to the RCT, we will also play an economic game. During the survey, we will run a variant of a dictator game measuring incoming reciprocity. Each individual is given 500 CFA. He will choose how much to keep and how much to distribute anonymously to each of the other households. Any money sent to others will be doubled. This game will be played again during the endline survey.  We will compare transfers to households that purchased the desludging service with those who did not. 

Payment mechanisms: We will also separately measure the effects of payment mechanisms on the willingness to pay for desludging services.  There are several different payment types that we are testing:  frequency of payments, the requirement of a deposit in addition to payment at the time of service, and the availability of savings accounts for general purposes in addition to the savings account earmarked for desludging.

Frequency of payments: Households receive reminders to save for their desludgings, and the frequency with which they are asked to pay in the reminders varies between at will, monthly, and payment at the time of service.

Earmarking: The earmarking treatment will compare those who received a single savings account earmarked for desludging with those who received both a desludging account and a normal savings account. Because not all participants will opt into the payment plan, we have adjusted our sample size to account for an estimated 40% expected takeup (hence 1600 participants in the earmarking experiment). For the earmarking experiment, our outcomes of interest are both total levels of savings and final use of the desludging services. We will compare the proportion of households who follow through with mechanical desludging after signing up for a subscription plan.

We estimate that use of the desludging services (follow-through rate) will be about 70% for those with one account. In order to detect an increase to 80% or higher, we require a sample size of at least 962.  We therefore believe our sample size of 1600 should be conservative for the earmarking treatment arms.  
In terms of the savings level outcome for the earmarking experiment, we expect a standardized effect size of at least 0.2, which suggests that we need a sample size of at least 1300. 

Deposit: About 3500 households will be asked to pay a deposit toward a subsidized desludging at the time of the decider survey, and 500 will be offered a subsidized desludging with no deposit. We will compare the proportion of households who follow through with mechanical desludging among those who left a deposit and those who did not. This sample size is sufficient to detect a 0.2 standardized effect size at 5% confidence with over 98% power.

Note that this treatment is cross-randomized with the payment plans. Half of each deposit treatment arm will receive a subscription payment plan. We expect the effect of the commitment deposit treatment to be similar across the different subsidy levels.

Spillovers: Two households (out of 12) within each cluster will not receive any treatment in order to measure spillover effects. We estimate the sample size necessary in order to have 95% power to calculate an effect that is statistically different from 0 at a 5% level of confidence, and still adjust for likely intra-cluster correlation of the two households. 

Using a similar framework in estimating the effect of learning on adoption of mosquito nets, Dupas (2010) finds a standardized effect size of having all neighbors receive the maximum subsidy of 0.44. (The coefficient on the share of households with the maximum subsidy within 500 meters is 0.215, and the standard deviation of adoption is 0.489.) We estimate the necessary sample size assuming a more conservative standardized effect size of 0.2 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.2. With 2 households per cluster, the cluster-corrected power calculation suggests that we need 780 spillover households to compare with 3900 participant households. We will therefore use all 400 of our project clusters, for a total of 800 spillover households. ","We use cluster randomization across neighborhoods in Dakar, with each cluster and household assigned to treatment through randomization in Matlab.","There are various randomized treatments. Some of these are randomized at the neighborhood cluster level, and some are individually randomized. Each neighborhood cluster contains 12 households: 10 treated and 2 spillover.


Cluster-level randomized treatments:
Public / private treatment: the values of neighbors' subsidy prices are shared with others in their cluster in half of the clusters in order to observe the effect of pressure from the neighbors on the take up of desludging services.
Learning from others treatment: half of neighbors are told who (half are told how many) of their neighbors chose to take up the desludging subscription.

Individual-level randomized treatments:
Subsidy levels: subsidy levels are randomized at the household level, and the number of high versus low subsidies varies across the different clusters.
Payment frequency: households receive reminders to save for their desludgings, and the frequency with which they are asked to pay in the reminders varies between at will, monthly, and payment at the time of service.
Earmarking treatment: some households are offered one earmarked desludging account while others are offered two accounts (one earmarked and one general savings account)

Otilonium Bromide as Spasmolytic during Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/429,"July 11, 2014",2014-07-04 14:35:50 -0400,AEARCTR-0000429,"Barış Sevinç, drbarissevinc@gmail.com",completed,2013-04-01,2013-08-30,"[""health"", """"]","","Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is commonly used in diagnosis and treatment of biliary and pancreatic disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of OB use during ERCP on duodenal motility, the tolerability of the procedure (by patients) and the difficulty of the procedure (by the endoscopist).


Method: The study was enrolled in Konya Training and Research Hospital General Surgery Endoscopy Unit in randomized prospective pattern. The patients were divided into two groups as spasmolytic and control groups. The procedure was performed under topical anesthesia and sedation. 

Results: There were 100 cases included into the study (50 cases in each group). The mean duodenal motility score was found to be 1.9 ± 0.5 in the study group and 3 ±0.6 in the control group. In the study group, the tolerability of the procedure score by the endoscopist was moderate in 16% and well/very well in 78% of the cases. On the other hand, in the control group, the scores were poor in 21%, moderate in 71% and well /very well in 24% of the cases. In terms of patient satisfaction, in study group 42% of the cases reported the procedure as moderate and 58% reported as well/very well. However, in the control group 16% of the cases reported the procedure as poor, 58% moderate and 26% as well/very well.

Conclusion: Otilonium bromide is a safe agent with low side effects. It can be used before the ERCP procedure to decrease the duodenal motility. It eases the procedure, moreover, it increases the patients’ satisfaction.
",2013-04-01,2013-08-30,"The key outcomes of the study are as follows;
1. Duodenal motility
2. Patient's satisfaction about the procedure
3. Endoscopist's satisfaction about the procedure","","The patients above 18 years of age who accepted to be involved in the study and with no known allergy to the agent will be included to the study. Emergent cases, cases with low mental status and the pregnant women will be excluded from the study.  To all the patients the design of the study will be explained and written consent will be taken. Another resident will divide the patients into spasmolytic (study) and control group consecutively. To the patients in study group, 2 tablets of OB (2x40 mg otilonium bromide) will be given as to take with a little water 2 hours before the procedure, orally. No drugs will be given to control group. 
The ERCP procedures will be performed under routine topical anesthesia and sedation. For the sedation 0.1 mg/kg midazolam (Dormicum amp, Roche) will be administered intravenously. As the endoscopist would not know the groups, during the procedure IV hyoscine-n-butylbromide (Buscopan amp, Zentiva) will be administered according to the endoscopist’ wish. During the procedure another resident will score the duodenal motility from 1 to 5 according to the following scale:
			1: no contraction
			2: less than 5 contractions in a minute
			3: 5-10 contractions /minute
			4: 11-15 contractions /minute
			5: continued contractions
At the end of the procedure the endoscopist will score the patients’ tolerability procedure as poor, moderate, well or very well.
After the procedure another resident will ask the patients’ satisfaction as poor, moderate, well or very well. The co-workers who take the informed consent, randomize the patients into groups, score the motility and make the analysis will be independent from each other and will not know the groups.

TFA focuses on expanding the pool of teachers for the most disadvantaged students in the U.S. by recruiting recent college graduates from some of the nation's best colleges for two-year teaching commitments in urban and rural public schools. Since the program's inception in 1990, it has provided more than 33,000 teachers who have taught more than 3 million children.

The evaluation was conducted in 17 high-poverty elementary schools in 6 regions around the country where TFA places teachers. We randomly assigned students to classrooms within the same grades and schools to ensure that teachers had equivalent groups of students and faced the same working conditions. Researchers administered a standardized test, then compared the performance of the students of TFA and non-TFA teachers. The findings provided information to educators about whether hiring TFA teachers helped alleviate teacher shortages without hurting student performance. They also informed the national debate on alternatives to traditional methods for recruiting and training new teachers.

The evaluation consisted of a pilot study in one school district during the 2001-2002 school year and a full-scale study in five other TFA regions during the 2002-2003 academic year. Along with scores from a standardized test administered at the beginning and end of the school year, researchers also collected student data from school records and teacher data from teacher surveys.

The study found that TFA teachers had a positive impact on students' math achievement. Average math scores were higher in classes taught by TFA teachers than in classes taught by non-TFA teachers. The size of this effect was equivalent to one additional month of instruction. In contrast, students in TFA and non-TFA classrooms had similar reading scores. As part of the study, we also compared TFA teachers to the certified non-TFA teachers and found the same result: a positive impact on math scores and no impact on reading scores.

This is the first study in the U.S. to use a randomized trial to estimate the impact of vision services on student outcomes.  In order to rigorously test of the efficacy of FLVQ’s services, we conducted a randomized trial targeting 4th and 5th grade students in Title 1 schools where FLVQ had not had a significant presence over the last two years. The randomization was done at the school level in three school districts (i.e. three counties). Schools were assigned to one of two intervention groups or to a control group. The first intervention group received additional/enhanced vision screening. The second intervention group received additional/enhanced vision screening as well as free onsite eye exams by an optometrist and free eyeglasses as needed. The control group received no vision services from FLVQ. Preliminary results find that providing additional/enhanced screening alone is not enough to improve student outcomes. In two of the three school districts studied, the intervention which included free exams by an optometrist and free eyeglasses as needed significantly improved student achievement as measured by the FCAT. When we focus on these two school districts, we find that, averaging over all students – including those who did not receive eyeglasses – FCAT level scores (which range from 1-5) increased on the order of 0.08 for reading and 0.09 for math in schools where FLVQ provided screenings and follow-up vision services. This evidence is robust to different specifications and the effect is stronger for low-income students and for students with poor vision. This is a large effect and suggests that vision services are more cost-effective than many other potential uses of district and/or state funds.  These preliminary results are based on data from the 2012 FCAT. When the test was administered, students who received free eyeglasses had had their glasses for only a few months.

These individuals often face serious risks from weather fluctuations – above all, erratic, excess or inadequate rainfall. Households attempt to informally insure themselves against these risks by diversifying the crops that they grow and by relying on friends and family in times of distress. However, informal mechanisms do not work as well when everybody in a given area is affected by the same adverse weather event. Historically, formal yield-based crop insurance has suffered from monitoring, selection, and incentive problems as well as high administrative costs.

Rainfall index insurance is a product that could help farmers hedge against agricultural losses due to excess or deficit rainfall, which is often cited as the largest risk to agricultural households. In a rainfall index product, policies pay out when rainfall exceeds or falls below pre-determined triggers based on historical rainfall data. Payouts are easy to calculate and index-based policies are simple to price since rainfall data are readily available. Another advantage of rainfall insurance is that the transaction costs can be low since insurance companies do not need to verify claims. Further, since farmers have no control over the level of rainfall, their choices to adopt the insurance or modify other behavior do not affect the sustainability of the insurance, in contrast to many yield-based crop insurance programs.

This randomized evaluation will help shed light on decision-making about weather risk and evaluate the potential of rainfall insurance to improve the livelihood and sustainability of rural poor households.

The first incentive manipulation implemented was a price discount, to estimate the elasticity of demand. In addition, willingness to pay for the rainfall insurance has been elicited repeatedly via the Becker-Degroot-Marschak (BDM) methodology. The random offer prices induce random variation in coverage, supporting the intent-to-treat impact evaluation design.

Enumerator teams visited over 200 schools to recruit students and administer baseline surveys. Teams first asked school administrations for permission to advertise the program and asked them to gather all Senior 6 students in one room at the appointed time. School staff members were asked to leave the classroom to preserve confidentiality and to avoid putting undue pressure on students. When students were assembled, the enumerators gave a brief introduction to SEED, highlighting key information that would influence their decision to apply for the program: enrollment was free; a round-trip transport refund would be provided; the training was a residential program that provided meals; students would have the chance to write business plans and enter a competition for a large cash prize. 
Enumerators explained to students that as there was limited space in the program, not everyone would be admitted, but that they all have an equal chance of admission into SEED.
All students interested in the program were asked to fill out both a simple application form and a baseline survey, which was framed as purely research-oriented and with no bearing on a student’s chances of being accepted. The application form took about five minutes to fill out and asked students to provide detailed contact information.  It also included the question “If you participate in the SEED training, what business would you start and how would you start & run it?” This question was included to indicate to students that SEED would accept serious applicants who have given some thought to the idea of starting their own businesses. After data entry and randomization into treatment and control groups, teams were re-deployed to schools to post lists of admitted students and distribute personalized acceptance letters.
The baseline questionnaire included modules on household information, economic activities, and psycho-social indicators, as well as measures of cognitive ability, risk behavior, and time preferences. Each scale was validated using data from pre-testing on Ugandan secondary school students. The evaluation team adjusted wording, formatting, question phrasing and answer choices in an iterative process based on feedback from focus group discussions and classroom pilots, in order to make the questionnaire understandable and easy to fill out for upper-secondary students.  
Due to the infeasibility of administering one-on-one surveys to large numbers of students in a school setting, the baseline survey was self-administered. Each student received a copy of the questionnaire and completed it independently, though the process was guided by an enumerator team who read and explained certain sections aloud and proctored the remainder. The survey consists of 10 sections and took 1-1.5 hours to administer. Enumerators were trained to walk around the room and monitor students closely while they were completing the survey to check for student errors and to make sure students were not copying their neighbors. They were instructed not to assist students in answering knowledge-based questions, such as calculation of profit or interest. Enumerators were, however, permitted to help student in cases that would enable them to better understand a question by defining a commonplace word that the student had trouble with, for example.  
Enumerator team leaders audited a random selection of ten surveys in each batch, counting numbers of errors in student completion of the survey. These include blanks, circling errors (i.e. circling too many options), skip pattern errors, illogical values, and illegible writing. Team leaders then gave feedback to enumerator teams on how to improve their monitoring during the survey.
Enumerators encountered some variation in the ability of S.6 students to understand the survey, based on their familiarity with English and prior exposure to similarly structured exams. It should also be noted that though enumerators monitored students during the survey, the evaluation team cannot rule out the possibility that questions were filled out improperly by students who did not ask questions or who encountered difficulty when an enumerator was in another part of the room, particularly in larger schools.
Some enumerators reported that they suspected students thought that IPA was ""testing"" them, and that students would be admitted based on whether they filled out the survey completely or had the ""right"" answers, for instance. Enumerators had stressed prior to the survey administration that all students have an equal chance of admission and the survey is merely for research purposes.
Some enumerators reported that some students perceived some of the psychosocial questions as too personal. Enumerators had indicated that students were not obligated to answer questions that made them uncomfortable; this was also printed in the consent form. They also had the impression that students became fatigued toward the end of the psychosocial section because of the large number of questions.
Understanding of the question ""Would you rather receive 10,000 today or 30,000 in a month"" may have been inconsistent; some students were initially unsure about whether it meant they would receive 10,000 every day or just once. A question that asked students to indicate the extent to which they agreed with the statement ""I have restless nights"" also caused initial confusion and differing interpretations among some students.
","The hard skills training was built upon a currently existing hard skills-based curricula developed by the ILO called Know About Business (KAB), which has been run in over 40 countries worldwide. The training focused on the following standard modules for business skills training: 
•	Financial literacy, including calculating interest rates and general business numeracy. 
•	Developing a business proposal. By the end of the course, the students are expected to have completed a basic business plan. The business plan will serve as a blue print for the students in their business and help in accessing finance.
•	The role of budgeting in the successful development and implementation of a business. 
•	How to calculate and keeping track of expenses, revenue and profits. 
•	The importance of re-investment in the business for business growth.
•	How to draft a marketing strategy.
•	Methods for planning staff needs.
•	How to cost goods and services effectively. 
•	Optimal legal form of the business including process for getting licenses and the permits.
•	How to assess of the environmental impact of planned business.
•	Forecasting finances.
•	A business game that simulates business operations to experiment on the challenges of managing small businesses with product portfolios in different markets.
The soft skills curriculum was developed by the researchers for the purpose of this experiment, using an existing curriculum from the NGO Educate! as a base model. For 100 years psychologists have theorized that there is much more to human intelligence than “hard” or quantitative intelligence. The concept of “Social Intelligence” began to gain traction in the 1920’s with E. L. Thorndike’s seminal work. Since then, all models and theoretical treatments of emotional and social intelligence factor out to a few fundamental underlying dimensions (Riggio, 1986 ; Salovey & Mayer, 1990 ; Thorndike, 1920 , 1936 ). These dimensions all describe (1) the ability to appraise one’s own and others’ emotional and motivational states, and (2) the ability to regulate or control these states within oneself and in others and (3) use such emotional and motivational information toward advancing an a social goal such as to influence, persuade, transact effectively, communicate more clearly, or befriend more quickly. 
The training was designed to focus on a suite of trainable skills harvested from psychology, sociology, and economics (named “soft skills” by the business community) which predict facets of entrepreneurial success (e.g., Moss & Tilly, 1996 ; Nickson, Warhurst, Commander, Hurrell, & Cullen, 2011 ). Many scientists and practitioners have argued strongly for the increased reliance upon soft-skills training and education in business education (e.g., Burke, Drasgow, & Edwards, 2004 ; Navarro, 2008 ). For example, having a particular structure to one’s social network leads to an increased likelihood of having entrepreneurial success (Stuart & Sorenson, 2005 ). Thus, knowing how to build and structure one’s social network is of utmost importance to increasing the likelihood of entrepreneurial success.
The four most critical and predictive dimensions of “soft skills” build on each other and are taught in the following order: (1) Building and Maintaining Social Networks, (2) How to Perceive and Listen to Others, (3) How to Influence & Persuade Others, and (4) How to Effectively and Creatively Negotiate. The last module, negotiation, pulls together many of the skills taught over the course of the teaching term. Below is a brief background and pedagogical plan for each. The content for these 4 modules will be taken directly from the YEP and Educate! Curricula and supplemented and edited to reflect the most cutting edge insights from business education. Materials will be grounded deeply by the cultural fabric understood by Ugandan youth by a hired teaching assistant who has had extensive experience with the Ugandan culture and teaching in Uganda.
In addition, special attention was paid to social networks. To be a successful entrepreneur, the people you know are as important as your idea is (Stuart & Sorenson, 2005 ). In addition, it is not only who you know, but who THEY know. Below are diagrams of two kinds of networks. The diagram on the left (Panel A) depicts an “embedded network.” Families, classes, and small work-groups are described by embeddedness: everyone knows everyone fairly well. This kind of network is not particularly effective for launching an entrepreneurial idea because these networks are small, informationally and resource redundant, and you can’t “buy” others’ help by introducing them to anyone (i.e., “brokering” between otherwise unconnected networks). In contrast, the network on the right (Panel B) depicts what has come to be known as an “entrepreneurial network.” In this kind of network, you know many different kinds of KEY people who have access to whole other networks non-redundant with your own. Principles taught in this module include: (1) what does your current social network look like? (2) What kinds of additions do you need to your network? (3) How to add different kinds of people to your network. (4) How to broker connections between people (and their associated networks). (5) Strategies to maintain contacts after they have been established. (6) How to call on people when you need them. (7) What is the difference between weak and strong social network connections?
One of the common assumptions made about influence is that “some people are just good at it.” This is incorrect. One of the common assumptions made about persuasion is that only some people can be persuaded—this is also incorrect. This module teaches Cialdini’s (e.g., Cialdini, 2001 ) 6 building blocks of persuasion: (1) reciprocation, (2) liking, (3) commitment and consistency, (4) authority, (5) social proof, and (6) scarcity. Students are given in-class and out-of-class assignments in which they will practice their influence and persuasion skills to: (a) persuade others of their point of view on an issue, (b) sell goods, and (c) trade upwards from a small object to as valuable an object as possible in 5 trades (the winner of this context receives a prize and public recognition).
The ability to read other people and know their intentions, goals, preferences and emotions is a skill that helps you manage them, persuade them, coordinate them, manage conflicts between them, know when they are lying to you, and enlist them toward your vision and goals. At the most basic level, watching and listening to others and what they say, is a critical skill that most of us do not have the tendency to do. This is a skill which can be taught through practice in a classroom setting with materials (e.g., photos of African faces expressing different emotions) train the accurate detection of emotions such as: happiness and sadness. Antecedents and consequences of emotional experiences are discussed at length. Further, “people reading” skills are also taught in dyads (people working with each other to predict and then test how each other is feeling in various role-plays and improvisations) and in small groups. Role plays to practice listening skills will be used to exercise the critical point that a person cannot know what another person wants or feels unless you stop your own mind from thinking what you want and feel and listen to and think about their wants and feelings.
The final module builds on the previous three modules and also contains unique value-added hands-on learning. The primary assumption shattered in this module is that all negotiations are about a fixed resource (i.e., “the myth of the fixed pie”). Negotiations are NOT always a zero-sum game. In fact, more often than not there are creative and integrative solutions to problems such that both parties can trade what they are least interested in for what they are most interested in (provided the other party has the reciprocal valuation of the same commodities). These critical learning points are covered. Students are given opportunities to practice utilizing the skills in the classroom (in dyadic simulated negotiations) and in the community with strangers. They are also given skills to learn how to “expand the pie” and think creatively about solutions to common problems. Principles taught are: (1) how to expand the goods being discussed (i.e., the myth of the “fixed-pie”), (2) how to build relationships during a negotiation (and before and after), (3) how to be more directive and assertive when appropriate, (4) different types of issues facing negotiators, Students will engage in a number of in-class and out-of-class negotiations in order to demonstrate and practice each concept.
","Between November 2012 and April 2013, IPA sent 3 rounds of mass SMS reminders and did 2 rounds of intensive calling (i.e. called all individuals in the treatment group). The last round took place shortly before the program launch. Efforts to reach students or their close relatives on the phone included calling every phone number the student had provided at different times of day, and calling the school administrators and student leaders (whom IPA designated to help mobilize their peers).
Once the program had launched, teams in schools with low turnout also called students who didn't turn up. IPA offered a transport refund to each student as a part of efforts to encourage students to participate, a fact which was emphasized during initial recruitment, as many students had to travel long distances to attend the training. 
To further reduce costs incurred by students, IPA organized mass transportation rather than expect students to find their own way to the training sites, some of which were relatively remote. The team asked students to meet at a well-known location in a nearby town, where IPA team members waited to greet students and load them onto buses to the training sites. About two-thirds of individuals in the treatment group eventually attended training. 
To train SEED instructors, IPA partnered with Educate!, an NGO that delivers social entrepreneurship training and mentorship to Ugandan secondary-school students. Educate! periodically trains groups of potential teachers in general techniques for teaching entrepreneurship skills. Educate! recruited and trained the majority of the SEED teachers in two rounds in October 2012 and February 2013. After the pilot, the implementation team realized that it was necessary to increase the number of teachers at each training site in order to make their workload more manageable. Time constraints made it difficult for Educate! to train additional teachers, so IPA asked another education NGO called the Private Education Development Network (PEDN) to recruit and train a third group. After all teachers had undergone a general training in teaching methods, IPA trained them on the curriculum to which they had been assigned as well as the business plan curriculum.
The student trainings took place at secondary schools with which Innovations for Poverty Action partnered to implement the program. Students slept and boarded at the schools, attending training sessions during the day. Each student also wrote a business plan guided by daily instruction in the business plan curriculum; a cash grant of UGX 1,000,000 ($400) was awarded to the author of the highest quality business plan in each school (one out of every 100-120 students). 
In addition to instructors, IPA trained two “camp directors” per training site to run the day-to-day operations, including handling finances, managing members of the school’s support staff that IPA retained, enforcing discipline, and organizing sports and social activities. The camp directors were supervised by a Field Officer, who was in turn supervised by a regional Field Manager. In January 2013, IPA carried out a pilot in a non-sample district to test the logistical arrangements and curriculum quality, making adjustments to the implementation plan accordingly.
A team of IPA-trained auditors observed teachers’ lessons on a rotating basis, using forms that recorded teachers’ adherence to lesson content, application of quality teaching methods, and details on the learning environment. In addition, students were asked to complete a variety of self-administered evaluations over the course of the training that asked about teaching quality, relevance of lessons, student characteristics, and their experience of SEED camp, among others. They also completed a knowledge assessment covering both hard and soft skills at the beginning and end of the camp. Auditors conducted focus groups at the end of the first and final weeks of the training that delved more deeply into student opinions on the lessons, teaching, and overall experience. Finally, teachers recorded student attendance at the start of each lesson.
A variety of problems arose over the course of the training. In some schools, students complained about the food provided, poor dormitory conditions, and particular camp rules. This was typically addressed by having one of the higher-level SEED supervisors step in, for instance to monitor the school support staff to improve food quality. Some students had been under the impression that SEED would be a relatively luxurious training given the involvement of foreign donors and the way it had been advertised (a free training with an opportunity to win cash grants) and were disappointed with the food quality and actual number of cash grants to be awarded, for instance. At one school, students briefly went on strike over such issues before higher-level SEED organizers were able to calm them down. 
In one school the living conditions were very poor, which had demoralizing effects on the teachers and students. The implementation team worked quickly to shift all the students to a nearby SEED school that could accommodate them. In the same school shortly before the move, a student went to the nearby river to swim, despite warnings by school administrators, and drowned. The incident caused significant distress among teachers and students; lessons were canceled for two days and began again the following Monday. 
One the final night of training in one of the rural schools, one of the auditors reportedly was out in the nearby town until very late at night with the school doctor and three female students. He was also observed on multiple occasions assisting one of the students with her business plan. This was the only reported case of inappropriate conduct between IPA staff and trainees.
","",Randomization on computer,"Power calculations indicated that 1200 students were required in each arm (hard skills treatment, soft skills treatment, and control group), or 30 students in each of the 80 classes across 20 training sites. Taking into account attrition estimates from similar programs and the long waiting time between recruitment and program implementation, the evaluation team over-enrolled by one-third and accepted 1600 students in each treatment arm, or 40 students per class. The control group remained at 1200 students.
The random assignment of students to hard skills treatment, soft skills treatment, and control was carried out for each region individually using the same series of commands. First the random-number seed was set to ensure the randomization could be replicated. Each student was assigned a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. The sample was then sorted by the random number in ascending order within the strata of school and gender. Each student received a treatment status of 0 (control), 1 (hard skills), 2 (soft skills), or 3 (not in sample). In order to achieve the desired number of students in each status, a particular fraction of each specified group (i.e. students by gender by school) was multiplied by the total number of students in that group. 
Of the 200 schools visited during data collection and recruitment, 20 eventually served as training sites. The distribution of training sites were chosen based on the number of individuals in the sample surveyed in each region in order to achieve fairly even numbers across regions. Roughly 40% of the sample attended school in the West, 40% from the East (including 20% in the Jinja area and 20% in the Mbale area), and 20% from the North. As a result, 8 sites were located in the West, 8 in the East, and 4 in the North.  The evaluation team divided the sampled schools in each region into geographical clusters, with a pair of host schools/training sites – one devoted to hard skills and one to soft skills – at the center of each cluster. This arrangement minimized the distance students would have to travel to get to the SEED training while serving the evaluation design.
Within each training site, each student was randomly assigned to a particular class for the duration of the training. Roughly 160 students were assigned to each site and were divided into 4 classes of 40 each. The class randomization code first assigns a random number to each student. Then it sorts all students by that number in ascending order, within each host school. The first 25% are assigned to class #1, the second 25% to class #2, etc. 
Teachers were randomly assigned to teach hard skills, soft skills, or the business plan curriculum. The randomization was then checked for balance on a range of indicators, including gender, ethnic group, whether the teacher had prior teaching experience, education level, cognitive ability, score received during the general teacher training (if they were trained by Educate!), and aptitude for hard or soft skills (based on a short questionnaire). Teachers who were trained by Private Education Development Network (PEDN) were all assigned to teach the business plan curriculum due to the systematic difference between PEDN and Educate!’s training styles.
The evaluation team introduced a cross-cutting design in which half of the students received a lesson on how to use technology in business and the other half received a lesson on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Half of the hard skills teachers taught one and the other half taught the other; the same was true for soft skills teachers. Since the technology and SRH modules were the last lesson in the main hard/soft skills curriculum, business plan teachers did not teach the special modules and were excluded from the randomization. Hard/soft skills teachers were first sorted in random order within their curriculum groups; the first 10 were assigned to SRH and #11-20 were assigned to technology. The evaluation team then checked that each group was balanced on average on the same group of indicators used in the randomization of teachers to curricula.
Randomizing teacher allocation to districts was performed last. Teachers were asked to indicate their top three district preferences. Because teachers overwhelmingly preferred urban districts to rural ones, the evaluation team also used data on teachers’ language abilities. First, because few teachers were interested in working in the Northern region, teachers who did prefer to work there were assigned to Northern schools. The remaining teachers were randomly assigned to districts according to language group, regardless of their district preferences. Teachers in smaller language groups were assigned first; Luganda speakers were assigned last.

Si,t - Si,t+1 = α + βT + γXi + δR + εi					(1)
where i refers to an individual, S is the score of the test delivered before the program (time t) and after the program (time t+1), T is a matrix of dummy variables for which treatment an individual belonged to, X is a matrix of individual controls, R is a matrix of region and school dummies, and ε is the error term. This estimation will test for the changes in knowledge of hard and soft skills. 
To test the differential effects of each program on the hypotheses presented in Section 4 and Table 2, we will run the following intention to treat (ITT) regression model:
Yi = α + βT + γXi + δR + εi						(2)
where i refers to an individual, Y is the outcome of interest, T is a matrix of dummy variables for which treatment an individual belonged to, X is a matrix of individual controls, R is a matrix of region and school dummies, and ε is the error term. The standard errors will be clustered at the school of origin level. 
In addition to the outcomes in Equation 2, we will also explore the effect of a number of heterogeneities as discussed in Section 4 and Table 2. This will be done using the following regression model:
Yi = α + βT + λT*H + ωH + γXi + δR + εi				(3)
which includes the addition of the interaction term H, which is the heterogeneity of interest. H will be represented as a dummy variable and will also be included as a control in the regression. Again, standard errors will be clustered at the school of origin level.
A final analysis will focus on social network effects. Students were randomly placed into classrooms with other students. The interactions that likely occurred within the classrooms could affect what is commonly referred to as the strong and weak ties of individuals. To test for this, a social network analysis approach will be used. This analysis will include individual and similarity tests. The individual test will use the following regression model:
Yi = α + βT + γXi + δR + φX-i + εi					(4)
The difference between this test and Equation 2 is that the characteristics of the other students in the class, X-i, have been included. These characteristics will allow for a test of the role of other student characteristics in outcomes for student i. 
Following Fafchamps and Soderbom (forthcoming), we will also look at the difference between student i and the other students in the same classroom though a distance measure as follows:
|Yi – Ŷ-i|= α + βT + γXi + δR + εi					(5)
where Ŷ-i  is the average outcome of all other students in the class of student i. This will test for whether there is an increase or decrease in outcome differences between those in the same classrooms.

Values Affirmation Exercise in Indian Schools,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/410,"July 11, 2014",2014-06-20 02:35:20 -0400,AEARCTR-0000410,"Nobuhiko Fuwa, nfuwa@waseda.jp",on_going,2013-12-01,2016-07-31,"[""education"", """"]","","The social psychological research on ""self-affirmation"" has demonstrated that brief psychological interventions can have a long-term impact by alleviating psychological threat, such as social identity threat. Among such interventions that have been tested repeatedly in the US is the values affirmation (VA) exercise, the experimental manipulation of having people write about core personal values (Cohen and Sherman 2014). The exercise is easy to implement and typically takes less than 30 minutes. 

Empirical studies based on randomized control trials demonstrate that a set of relatively brief writing exercises repeated over the course of an academic year can be effective in countering social identity threats and thereby closing the learning gaps between the minority (such as African American and Latino students) and non-minority students in middle schools (e.g,. Cohen et al 2006). Similar effects have been observed for socioeconomically disadvantaged students and for female students (learning physics) at the college level. 

We test whether similar effects can be replicated in the context of the potential social identity threats among school children within the Indian caste system. We randomly assign students in 7 to 10th grade into the treatment and control groups and implement a similar set of values affirmation exercises as conducted in the US. We monitor the administrative records of examination scores and attendance of the participating students before and after the intervention (up to two years) to measure the impact. In addition, in order to understand the mechanisms through which the psychological intervention works, we conduct baseline and follow-up surveys of the students and of their households to obtain information on student network patterns, household characteristics and learning environments of the students.  

If found effective, similar psychological interventions may be considered as a potential policy option for improving learning achievements among children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds that is inexpensive and relatively easy to implement in developing country settings.

Students in the treatment group complete a brief essay writing assignment confirming their values, following Cohen et al (2006).  Students are first asked to review a set of values (such as relationships with family or friends, creativity, being smart), to choose the value that is the most important to them, and then to write a brief essay about why the selected value is important to them.

","","NRSP in agricultural areas usually works with so called community organizations (COs), which consist of 18 to 20 member households. Members of these community organizations are eligible for NRSP credit products with joint liability on the CO level. Further, NRSP offers non-agricultural credit products with joint liability to so called credit groups which usually consist of three member households. All NRSP credit clients and their spouses are covered by mandatory health and accidental death insurance. With this project NRSP gives existing credit clients the possibility to insure additional members of its household. The insurance innovations are randomly assigned to some Revenue Villages (RV), whereas no innovation will be implemented in other villages. Importantly, the latter RVs (control villages) do neither receive access to nor information about any of the innovations. There are six different groups: (i) control group, (ii) awareness campaign, (iii) individual insurance, (iv) individual insurance with high coverage, (v) household insurance, (vi) household insurance with group eligibility. I.e. we essentially vary the extent of information about the existing (mandatory) product and provide additional insurance products with varying coverage (in terms of amount and insured individuals).
At the household level, we furthermore cross-randomize prize discounts per insured individual and information about peer uptake.","The six different groups on the village level are: 
(i) Control group: Credit clients in this group of RVs receive no additional insurance service other than the already available mandatory health and accident insurance for client and spouse.
(ii) Awareness campaign: To control for the awareness effects created by the insurance innovation one group of RVs only receives information on the existing insurance coverage. Awareness sessions aim at providing exactly the same information (regarding the existing mandatory insurance) as the one provided in the process of marketing the new insurance innovations. The content of the awareness campaign was developed by NRSP and checked for conformity with the research design by University of Mannheim. 
(iii) Individual insurance: Additional to the mandatory insurance for client and spouse individual members can be covered at the cost of 100 rupees / year and individual (i.e. for each additional member that voluntarily takes up insurance). 
 (iv) Individual insurance with high coverage: This product is equivalent to the individual insurance described above, except that it doubles the coverage limit for hospitalization to 30,000 rupees / year. Premium payments are PKR 150 per insured household member.
(v) Household insurance: Additional to the mandatory insurance for client and spouse all other household members (those eligible according to the screening criteria) together may be covered at the cost of 100 rupees x number of additional household members / year. Compared to the individual insurance (iii) this might improve the risk pool of insured persons and hence the financial viability of the scheme. Also, the household package might be easier to administer. At the same time clients benefit from full protection of the household. On the other hand for large households the total additional premium may appear rather large and they might not insure.
(vi) Household insurance with group eligibility: Additional to the mandatory insurance for client and spouse household insurance can be purchased. In order to make the innovation eligible for the group members, at least 50% of client households in the CO / credit group need to take up. If this threshold is not met, the innovation is not available for the whole group. Compared to the household insurance (v) this might further improve the risk pool of insured persons and hence financial viability of the scheme. Also, there could be interesting impacts on informal risk-sharing. Fully insured households might be less willing to help uninsured households. This scheme prevents such a situation by imposing full or no additional insurance. Also, there even might be an incentive for those willing to insure to help financing insurance for the whole group.

As default, NRSP will offer the insurance product (iii), (v) and (vi) at a cost of 100 rupees per year and individual and the product (iv) at cost of 150 rupees per year and individual. To estimate demand for the products at different prices, vouchers with discounts will be distributed randomly to client households. Each household receives a discount with the following probability distribution:
-	No discount: 				25%
-	10 rupees per insured individual: 	25%
-	20 rupees per insured individual: 	25%
-	30 rupees per insured individual: 	25%
The discounts are drawn in private and are iid.

The second cross-randomization element is the order in which the members of the credit group / CO draw their respective discount voucher and take their final insurance decision. The important element here is that takeup decisions of clients taking their decision earlier are observable for those taking their decision later. This means there will be variation in peer behavior observed prior to the own take-up decision.","For discounts: individual lottery

The study will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an eleven week programme which focuses on improving the performance of fourth grade students in English, which is the second language for the majority of targeted students. The study will be conducted in the Pinetown district of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa.

As is the case for the majority of students in South Africa, those in the targeted schools experience a transition in the language of instruction at the fourth grade.  In grades 1 through 3 most schools teach in the Home Language of students (isiZulu in the case of Pinetown) and then transition to English as language of instruction in grade 4.  Research has demonstrated that most South African children in poor communities have accumulated large learning deficits in English proficiency by the fourth grade (Taylor, 2011).

The intervention consists of three components: scripted lesson plans, additional reading resources and in-class instructional coaching and training.

Our primary outcomes of interest follow directly from the predictions of the model presented in our pre-analysis plan. Namely, we predict that:
(i) treated farmers will be more likely to switch vets than control farmers, 
(ii) when treated farmers switch vets, they will be more likely to switch to a higher quality vet than control farmers who switch vets, 
(iii) distance to vets will be a weaker predictor of vet choice for treated farmers relative to control, 
and (iv) when treated farmers don't switch vets, they should pay a lower price than before treatment if their vet is below nearby vet quality or they should pay a higher price than before treatment if their vet is above nearby vet quality.

Additional secondary hypotheses groups are outlined in detail in our pre-analysis plan.
","We will test hypotheses in this group using both our call center data and our in-person survey data. Using our call center data, we will use actual, verified smartphone application form observations of service provision to farmers by vets, as well as reported price and vet quality data from farmers. We will limit our sample to farmers that have received a second AI service provision after being initially treated following a first AI service provision.

Using our in-person survey data, we will test these hypothesis with responses to questions from survey sections 4.1 and and 4.4, including 4.1.2-7, 4.1.10, 4.4.1-4, as well as with GPS coordinates of villages from our sample selection and GPS coordinates of each vet center collected by our field staff. Importantly, we will first create variables for each outcome, including a dummy for a farmer switching vets after treatment, for a farmer switching to a higher quality vet, for farmers paying higher or lower prices than before (equal to one if a post-treatment price is higher when a farmer doesn't switch vets and his vet is better than other nearby vets or if the price is lower and his vet is worse than other nearby vets), and for farmers choosing the vet that is closest to them in distance.","Sample selection
District selection
Sahiwal, Punjab, Pakistan was selected based on several logistical constraints, including our ongoing relationship with the Punjab Livestock and Dairy Development Department, travel distance to Lahore, the prominence of livestock and number of government vets in the district, and knowledge by our field staff. Though Sahiwal was not selected for its external validity, we do view it as generally representative of Punjab and of similar primarily agricultural, rural districts, with a slightly higher prevalence of livestock. According to the 2010 Punjab's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, households in Sahiwal on average have 1.4 acres less agricultural land and .24 more cattle than those across other districts in Punjab. Households in Sahiwal are also on average 3.8 percentage points more likely to be receieving government benefits and 1.9 percentage points more likely to have a head of household who completed primary school. Other indicators, such as a wealth index, labor force participation rates, and child mortality rates are no different in Sahiwal than the rest of Punjab on average. 

Village and household selection
The farmer selection process was different for each of the data sources outlined below. 

The smartphone application has recorded all government vet AI service provisions within Sahiwal since the onset of our program. Thus through it we have sampled the universe of farmers in Sahiwal that have received government AI services since November 23, 2013. To date we have recorded approximately 35,200 entries.

The call center aims to follow-up with every farmer form the smartphone application. In reality, farmers are not sampled for three reasons---(i) because we are not able to reach them on the phone because of an error by a vet entering a farmer's number, (ii) because we are not able to reach them on the phone because their number has changed, their phone was off when we called, they refused to answer our questions, etc., or (iii) because of capacity constraints at our call center. To date, we have completed calls with 7,910 of the 35,200 total smartphone entries.

For our in-person surveys, 90 of Sahiwal's approximately 500 villages were sampled at random from a district village census conducted less than one year prior to our program for another research project. The sample was stratified by whether or not a government vet center was in the village, and on whether the village was a canal colony. Our sample is balanced along the following variables: area, settled area, cultivated area, area of wheat, rice, cotton, sugar cane, pulses, orchards, and vegetables, having a river, distance to the nearest vet center, number of livestock in the village, the literacy rate of heads of households, religion, age, and standard wealth index characteristics.

Within each village, ten households were selected for our surveys. Households were selected using the well-documented EPI cluster sampling method, because of the cost constraints associated with first conducting village censuses. In order to be surveyed, households had to report owning at least two livestock (cows or buffalos) and having regular access to a cellular phone. We did not conduct a census of households so we cannot verify representativeness in this sample.

Treatment assignment
Treatment is administered at the farmer level. Two samples of farmers have been treated---(i) those farmers followed-up by the call center, during our two-month follow-ups, beginning September 16th, 2014 and continuing today, and (ii) in-person survey farmers, at one point of time during the month following November 10th, 2014, or during the two weeks following January 14th, 2015, regardless of whether they also were sampled through our smartphone application (note we were unable to reach all 900 in-person survey farmers on the phone. To date, we have reached 668 for treatment or control phone calls. This was done in two waves, with an in-person follow-up between the two waves to get phone numbers from households we had not yet reached). In both cases, treatment assignment has been through a coin-flip stratified on nearest government veterinary clinic to a farmer's household. In the case of farmers that have entered our smartphone application database more than once for follow-ups or farmers that are in both our call center and in-person samples, treatment assignment was carried forward from the initial assignment.

Data collection
Smartphone application
All government vets in Sahiwal are equipped with an Android phone with an Open Data Kit-based application and are instructed to submit an application form each time they provide AI services to a farmer. The application, made short to ensure that it is not too costly for vets, includes questions on location (sub-district and village names), farmer information (contact, household info), livestock information, and service provision information. It also records GPS coordinates at the point of each service provision (almost always at a farmer's home). As soon as a form is completed by a vet, recorded data is transmitted real-time through a cellular network to a web server.

To date, we have collected data from 35,200 completed smartphone submissions.

Call center
Agents at a call center contracted by our research team make two phone calls to each farmer that has received AI from a government vet in Sahiwal. First, the day after service provision, farmers are called to verify that the core information from the smartphone application recorded by their vet is correct, including the vet's name, the services provided, and the location of the farmer. Farmers are also asked to report the price that they paid for this service, which is not recorded on the smartphone application. Second, farmers are called two months after service provision to verify whether or not each of their animals given AI became pregnant. In addition, farmers selected for treatment are given our treatment information in this second phone call.

Smartphone application verification data, data on prices paid by farmers, data on AI success rates, and verification of treatment information provision are all automatically recorded on a web server, linked to the original smartphone application submission.

Farmer in-person surveys
This project includes three rounds of in-person surveys---a baseline survey, a phone number follow-up survey, and an endline survey. The baseline survey, administered to all 900 sampled farmers, was fielded during the last week of August and the first week of September, 2013. The phone number follow-up survey, fielded during the last two weeks of December, 2014, was administered to a subset of 500 of the 900 sampled farmers. The endline will be administered to all 900 sampled farmers in late May/early June, 2015.

The baseline and endline survey include a number of modules which will allow us to test our hypotheses. All hypotheses will refer to specification survey modules and questions. The phone number follow-up survey was used to obtain updated phone numbers for farmers that could not be reached using their phone number from the baseline survey. In addition, we used the follow-up survey to pilot several modules to help determine what will be in the endline for the entire sample.

Vet in-person surveys
This project also includes in-person baseline and endline surveys of all government vets who perform AI services in Sahiwal.

The study will also collect the following information from the schools. 
- the number of students graduating with a minor in economics, by gender;
- the number of students enrolled in the principles of economics sequence, by gender by class year;
- the number of students enrolled in the intermediate theory sequence, by gender by class year.","","A letter of invitation to participate in the Challenge was sent to 344 co-educational colleges and universities in the United States that had graduated at least 15 BA students from their economics program per year (averaged across the 2011 to 2013 period). Of the group contacted, 167 schools (or almost 50%) expressed an interest in the initiative. The letter of invitation did not give much detail but did state that all treatment schools would receive a maximum of $12,500 that could be used for any part of the intervention (e.g., guest speakers; lunches with faculty members; events with teaching fellows). 

Out of the 167 schools that volunteered to participate in the study, 88 were selected to be part of the ""treatable sample"" based on several institutional characteristics. Of the institutions in the treatable sample, 20 were randomly selected to be part of the treatment group, and the remaining 68 institutions were asked if they wished to be part of the control group. Of these, 35 schools volunteered to be in the control pool. 

Each treatment school will design their own intervention program aimed at recruiting more undergraduate women into economics, with some guidance from the trial organizers and our designated Board of Experts, with whom we met to design the experiment in November 2014. Treatment schools will begin implementing the interventions in the Fall 2015. The main intervention will last one year (Fall 2015 to Spring 2016), with some spillover into the following academic year (Fall 2016 to Spring 2017). Schools will receive funding from the study for the first full year. Schools may continue their intervention programs beyond that if they wish. 

Treatment schools will submit reports detailing their plan of intervention. Both treatment and control schools will be asked to provide aggregate numbers for several years prior to the start of the trial for students graduating with an economics BA. For the duration of the trial, they will also be asked to provide aggregate numbers for students enrolled in introductory and intermediate economics courses, and the major selection for students in the treatment cohort (Fall 2015 to Spring 2016) at the point of major declaration and upon their graduation. In addition, the trial organizers will use data provided in the IPEDS (US Department of Education) to collect aggregate numbers on the majors of graduating students at schools that did not respond to the letter of invitation to be in our sample of institutions interested in the Challenge. 

The trial organizers will conduct statistical analysis to determine what, if any, impact the intervention programs have on recruiting more women to major in economics by comparing the data from the treatment schools, the interested control schools, and the schools that never demonstrated an interest. Given the enormous interest that was expressed in the program and statements from control schools that they have been motivated by our Challenge, even though they were not randomly chosen as a treatment, we will look at time trends for all groups, particularly for the group that meets our criteria of size of program and selectivity. ","Due to the large number of responses, a decision was made to limit the institutions even further by the number of BA majors and the selectivity of the institution to increase the power by reducing the variance. Of the schools that expressed an interest, the sample was further reduced by the schools that had graduated fewer than 30 economics BAs per year (averaged across the 2011 to 2013 period), schools that were not in the (USN&WR) “top 100 universities” or the “top 100 colleges” and produced fewer than three economics PhD graduates across the 2008 to 2012 period, and all unranked schools.

Colleges and universities with the same ranking were ordered highest to lowest based on the average Verbal and Math SAT scores. Schools were then divided into four equal groups of 22 schools each, with a number 1 through 22 assigned to them based on their relative USN&WR rank.

canvassers had no knowledge that voters were participants in an online survey. Finally, to prevent
housemates from completing each other’s surveys, extensive precautions were taken, including issuing distinct personal login instructions to take differently named surveys, tracking of distinct IP addresses

Impact Evaluation of Scaling Up Sweet potato Through Agriculture and Nutrition (SUSTAIN) Project in Rwanda,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/559,"November 23, 2014",2014-11-22 17:54:31 -0500,AEARCTR-0000559,"Mywish Maredia, maredia@msu.edu",in_development,2014-11-24,2018-08-31,"[""agriculture"", ""health"", ""welfare"", """"]","Q12, Q16, Q18, D1, D03, D2, O12, O22, O32, O33, O55","Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a widespread health problem among young children and pregnant women in the developing world.  This problem is most serious in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Health Organization, 26% of preschool children are estimated to be deficient. One effective and low cost solution to fight VAD is to introduce a biofortified staple food crop that is rich in vitamin A, such as the beta-carotene-rich orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP). Although, sweet potato is one of the major staple food crops for many African countries, its production is dominated by white, yellow or cream colored sweet potato varieties that have very low vitamin A content. Clearly, greater effort is needed to scale up the adoption of OFSP and achieve the potential nutritional benefits of this technology. Scaling Up Sweet Potato Through Agriculture and Nutrition (SUSTAIN) is a project led by the International Potato Center (CIP) with support from the U.K. Department for International Development designed to achieve precisely this goal. It builds on recent advances in the biofortification of sweet potato and proof-of-concept research to deliver the benefits of OFSP to millions of farming households and thousands of urban and rural consumers in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Rwanda. 

Achieving “impact at scale” is at the heart of the SUSTAIN project. Concomitant to the goal of achieving ‘impact at scale,’ is the SUSTAIN project’s desire to deliver the production and nutrition benefits to millions of people effectively and efficiently. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to provide an objective and independent evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SUSTAIN project’s scaling up approach so as to support and facilitate the innovation process within the project, and to learn from it for future expansion. The RCT focuses on one SUSTAIN country -- Rwanda, where the project has set a goal of reaching 60,000 direct beneficiaries and 250,000 indirect beneficiaries by taking an integrated agriculture-nutrition-marketing approach. This integrated approach consists of implementing following components/strategies of promoting OFSP production, sale, and consumption in eight target districts across the Northern, Southern and Eastern Provinces in Rwanda: 

1.	Agriculture: The agriculture component includes two sub-components—vine distribution and agronomic training. The project plans to distribute vines of improved OFSP varieties to households with children less than 5 years old or with pregnant women. About 100 vines each of two selected improved varieties will be distributed free of cost to eligible households, followed by a second round of vine dissemination in the third season to the same households, but at a subsidized cost which will be a fraction of the normal cost. These beneficiary households will be targeted through farmer organizations or farmer field schools (FFS). Under the agronomic training sub-component, all the members (men or women) of the farmer organization or the farmer field school that will be targeted by the project for vine distribution will receive agronomic training on growing OFSP at the time of vine distribution and during the growing season.

2.	Nutrition: This component encompasses two strategic elements or sub-components—messaging and counseling. All the members of the farmer organization or the farmer field school (men and women), and pregnant women and lactating mothers who visit the local health facilities will receive nutritional ‘messages’ on the importance of OFSP as a source of vitamin A, which is essential for good health, and how OFSP as part of a balanced diet contributes to vitamin A intake. The nutrition ‘counseling’ sub-component will include incorporating the promotion of OFSP consumption in the on-going nutrition education curriculum of the community health worker and health center. In this counseling component, the emphasis will be on 'doing', 'demonstrating' and 'showing' rather than simply telling/informing about OFSP. All the women and caregivers in the village with children less than 5 years and pregnant women will be targeted for the counseling sub-component of the nutrition intervention. The SUSTAIN project will link the nutrition component with the planned and ongoing health and nutrition activities implemented by the Rwanda Ministry of Health through the health centers and community health workers (CHWs).

3.	Marketing:  The marketing interventions will include two sub-components—training and market linkage. All the members of the farmer groups and FFS that received vines will also receive in-depth (but context specific) training (delivered several times during the project phase) on how to process OFSP, market it, meet the demand for roots quality, and organize finances. Under the market linkage sub-component, the SUSTAIN project will actively promote the linkage between OSFP growers and processors and other actors in the value chain. This sub-component will focus on a proactive action by the project to find processors willing to work with farmers and then equipping the farmers with knowledge, tools and skills to ensure they meet the processors’ requirements in terms of roots quality and delivery schedules. CIP / SUSTAIN project implementers will work with groups/cooperatives and FFS in this component, but marketing is expected to take place at the household level.

This evaluation study in Rwanda uses a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) field experiment to test the effectiveness of different combinations of this integrated agriculture-nutrition-market approach of promoting the adoption and consumption of OFSP at scale. The research design consists of randomly assigning project villages to one of the following six treatment arms:

1.	Base model: All the components of the integrated Agriculture, Nutrition and Marketing approach
2.	Base model less nutrition counseling
3.	Base model less marketing 
4.	Base model less nutrition counseling and marketing
5.	Base model, but only one season
6.	Base model with the second time vine distribution at a higher price

These treatment arms are designed to include or exclude project components and sub-components that substantially differ in projected cost and benefits. Costs include both financial resources and human/institutional capacity to reach the target number of beneficiaries. Given SUSTAIN’s resource constraints, the goal is to maximize the number of beneficiaries (direct + indirect) per unit of cost. The benefits of the project are measured on two dimensions – a) by the total number of beneficiaries reached/impacted (i.e., the extensity dimension); and b) the average effect per beneficiary as measured by the adoption and consumption of OFSP by children, women and men three years after the project intervention (i.e., the intensity and sustainability dimension).

This RCT is designed to address the following research questions:
1.	Which combinations of market promotion and nutrition information dissemination are most cost effective for promoting production and consumption of OFSP by a large number of beneficiaries (scale) to meet their nutritional needs (intensity) over time (sustainability)?  
2.	Which factors are important in determining OFSP adoption by farmers, and their consumption among children and women? Do the different promotion strategies influence them differently? 
3.	How do the effects of various project components involving training and knowledge dissemination (e.g., nutritional information, market information) differ across different recipient and household characteristics (e.g., gender, age, education of recipient of training and of household head)?

The plan is to collect baseline and end-line data from a sample of project beneficiaries across all six treatment arms. In order to capture potential spillover effects (e.g., farmer to farmer sharing of vines and adoption of OFSP by households who were not directly targeted by the project), researchers will also collect some basic information for all households in selected treatment villages for this RCT in listing (or census) exercises both at baseline and end-line. This beneficiary level data in combination with cost tracking data to be collected by the project monitoring and evaluation team will be the bases for addressing the research questions identified for this evaluation.

The survey data will contribute to conducting a rigorous evaluation of SUSTAIN project interventions across a range of outcome indicators. These indicators include: adoption of OFSP, consumption of OFSP by children less than 5 and women of child bearing age (especially, pregnant and lactating women), frequency of foods rich in vitamin A, dietary diversity and history, infant and young child feeding practices, sweet potato production and productivity, market penetration, cost-effectiveness of scaling-up mechanisms and not least, gender outcomes and impacts. By measuring these indicators before and after project intervention, we will be able to assess how effective SUSTAIN strategies are in: improving the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A by children under age 5 and women of child bearing age; improving dietary diversity; encouraging planting of OFSP; encouraging consumption of OFSP; increasing incomes of farmers who sell OFSP in markets; and increasing agricultural production.

Here, we register the analysis plan, including the fully specified structural model. 
",2013-10-27,2015-12-25,"Effort exerted by workers in each session, measured as the number of envelopes stuffed (in each 20 minute session). ","","We hire temporary workers for a single day's employment, and within the day vary pay and other features of the work within subject (across different sessions) and between subjects. ","    We hire temporary workers for a single day's employment (about 5 hours of work) through posted ads on Craigslist.com. Workers prepare mailers -- i.e. fold and place materials in envelopes, working their way through a mailing list -- for fundraising and advertising campaigns. They work in ten sessions of 20 minutes each over the course of the day, for 4 different employers (three charities and one firm). The ten sessions include two training sessions where the prepared envelopes are not used, although the workers are paid for each envelope correctly prepared. Workers receive a single lunch break after the fourth work session of the day.
    The different sessions vary the following aspects of the work:
    1. The fixed amount ($0, $3.5 or $7) and piece rate per envelope ($0.20, $0.10 or $0 per envelope) paid to the workers
    2. The return to the employer of the work ($0 in training session, $0.6 per envelope or $0.3 per envelope before wage costs), implemented in some sessions with a (truthfully implemented) ""match"" to the funds raised from the mailings.
    3. The type of the employer (charity or firm)
    4. An unanticipated ""gift"" in the final two sessions: Either a higher fixed pay ($14) than received previously (positive monetary gift), the same fixed pay ($7), a lower fixed pay ($3, negative monetary gift) or else an in-kind gift (a thermos with the logo of the employing charity) in addition to the basic fixed pay of $7 (in-kind positive gift). Assignment to positive, positive in-kind, negative and neutral gift treatments within each daily session happens by stratifying on worker performance in the first half of the day, as described below.
    In each case, we observe the effort exerted by the worker. The response to variation in piece rates helps us identify the cost of effort function. The response of workers' effort to variation in the return to the employer helps identify and distinguish warm glow and pure altruism. The response to the gift treatments identifies the reciprocity parameters. Putting all the estimates together, we intend to determine the importance of worker altruism towards employers, and help interpret the magnitude of employees' positive or negative reciprocity to gifts.

    The experiment uses two types of between-subject variation:
    1. First, the order of the experimental sessions is randomized. There are 12 types of sessions, which vary (a) the session order (UP or DOWN), (b) the charity order (CHARITY ORDER 1, 2 or 3) in which one of the charities (B, RN or RIC) corresponds to Charity No 1 in the experimental design, and (c) the match order in the final two sessions (MATCH FIRST or MATCH LAST). This produces 2x3x2=12 treatment session types. The order of the 12 treatments was randomly drawn at the beginning of the study. We plan to hold at least 48 experimental sessions (of which 24 have already been completed as of the time of this posting) and ideally 72 total sessions if we can find enough subjects to recruit. In total, there will be at least 4 full loops through the complete set of 12 treatment sessions, and ideally 6 full loops. In any case, we will aim to run a completed loop though all the 12 sessions constituting one full run. On each day that the experiment is run, either one or sometimes two experimental sessions will be run (depending on how many individuals respond to the posted advertisement and show up).
    2. The second randomization is at the individual level, within a given experimental session. Randomization occurs during lunch within an experiment session and is used to determine whether a subject is put into the positive gift, in-kind gift, negative gift, or control (neutral) gift treatment. The total number of envelopes each subject created in the previous sessions is totaled and their rank determined. The highest and lowest rank were put into one treatment, the second highest and second lowest were put into another treatment, and the middle two were put into the third treatment. In the very first experimental session, the highest and lowest rank were randomly placed in the negative gift. Following this, in the second group, the highest and lowest rank were place in the the neutral gift. In the third session, they were placed in the positive gift. This pattern was then repeated. Thus, the randomization was one-time and affected which treatment the first pair of ""highest and lowest"" workers were assigned to. After that, assignment was deterministic, although of course it depended on worker performance on a given day. The goal was the have ability be balanced over time in the different gift treatments combining over all the sessions, and as similar as possible on average even within a session.
    NOTE: This experiment registration, including the full specification of the model and planned structural estimation, was written on 21 Nov 2014. This was after one full phase of data collection, with data on 131 subjects collected and two full rounds of treatment orders (that is, 24 sessions) completed. We plan to gather data on approximately 200 more subjects, making for a total of about 330 workers. But note that exact sample sizes will depend on (unpredictable) show-up of the invited workers. This will require collecting at least another two full rounds of treatment order sessions (T1-T12 twice over, in randomized order) and ideally four more full rounds (pending enough subjects to recruit). Notice that the only difference between the sessions run after Nov. 21, 2014 is the addition of an ""in-kind gift"" treatment, where workers are provided with an unanticipated gift (a thermos with the logo of the employing charity) in the gift periods, so the subjects are split four-ways in rounds 9-10. This treatment was not included in the first 24 sessions, since we thought of including this treatment after the initial 24 sessions.

In addition, we also utilize within-subject variation:
    Each worker works for 10 work sessions in day, during which they face varying incentives. This provides a rich source of within subject variation.
    The first of the ten work sessions for each subject is a training session, where the worker is paid to stuff practice envelopes, but the envelopes are discarded and not mailed by the employer (as always,   there is no deception in the experiment, and the envelopes are truly discarded as announced to the workers). The fifth session, which is immediately after lunch, is a second training session. The last two sessions -- 9 and 10 -- are always the gift sessions, where workers receive unanticipated positive, negative, in-kind gifts or no gift. The remaining six sessions (other than the two training and two gift sessions) vary in order in one of two ways. Each subject is assigned to either UP or DOWN order, each of which specifies a particular sequence of the work sessions. Importantly, the two orders are reversed or mirror images of each other (excluding the position of the training and gift sessions, which are fixed). Particular pay scheme + employer combinations are thus observed (in different subjects) in two different positions -- once early and once late in the day. By averaging across these two occurrences, we can partially deal with issues of learning and tiredness over the course of the day.

During the household survey, we will also collect qualitative data from households on perceived barriers to obtaining access to the scheme. We will also collect qualitative data from Panchayat heads on the perceived issues in implementing MNREGA. The proposed evaluation relies mostly on statistical analysis of administrative and household survey data. However, throughout the process, interviews of GoB staff in charge of MG-NREGS at the State and local level will also be conducted by the research team.

We will randomly select a sample of 5,000 households among the list of all poor households legally residing in each city. These administrative lists are created yearly following a standard and homogeneous procedure in order to provide social benefits to low-income people in each city of the Marche Region. Selected households will invited and incentivized to take part in an interview at the local town hall. Subjects showing up (which are expected to represent about half of the invited pool based on the pilot experience) will be administered a questionnaire and three lotteries to assess risk and time preferences. At the end of the baseline survey, they will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Aware of the existence of the two types of profile among our target population, we will condition treatment on the baseline account ownership in order to tackle both the need of basic financial inclusion and the need of savings incentives. People with no bank account (expected to be about 25% of the entire pool) will receive an invitation to open a current account at the local branch of our partner bank, where a trained loan officer will be waiting for them.  This is a basic transaction account, offering zero interest rate and being freely available through a debit card allowing payments and withdrawals. One out of three respondents will be offered the account at normal market price (T1) and the other two free of charge (T2). Since the first product is already present on the market, it represents a control group for the cost experiment. Yet, a positive response to our offer could imply the existence of a lack of trust and/or information about formal bank accounts. By contrast, a higher take-up of the free account would point at the cost issue. Provided we find a higher take-up in T2 than in T1 (which we expect based on the pilot results), we will then be able measure the real impact of holding a transaction account by following the two groups over time. Turning to the households who own already a current account at baseline, one out of five will be offered a free current account (T2), which will form the control group of the savings experiment, and two out of five a free savings account (T3). The savings account offers a competitive interest rate and is accessible only at the bank’s branch. The remaining participants will be offered a variant treatment consisting in the same savings account complemented with an initial monthly savings goal elicitation and a monetary incentive to respect it during one year (T4). For banked people, T2 could represent an improvement (in which case we would observe a positive take-up) by providing (i) a cheaper transaction account that would be used to replace their previous one, or (ii) a second account that would encourage savings through a ‘mental accounting’ effect. With respect to T2, T3 offers (i) a small remuneration on deposits (2% interest rate), (ii) a lower liquidity given that savings cannot be accessed through the debit card but only by going at the bank, and (iii) a specific savings label. Finally, T4 adds a commitment option that could help savers facing self-control problems. By comparing take-up rates between treatment groups, we will be able to assess the relative relevance of each of those. Moreover, by observing the allocation of funds between the current and savings accounts, we will be able to check if the savings account has indeed a specific added value. We will measure the impact of treatments by following the standard procedure of submitting a common baseline and endline questionnaire to all treated and control individuals, in order to quantify the change in different economic and behavioral outcomes.

Alarmingly, this situation has been worsening across most states in India over time; the corresponding figures in 2007 were 59% and 42%.

A variety of ""interventions"" have been devised and tested to improve educational outcomes in India. A series of rigorous impact evaluations of Pratham’s (India's leading NGO in the sphere of education) work over the past decade have consistently found two effects: first, that volunteers make a difference in learning outcomes of children; and second, that learning gains in basic skills are greater and faster if children are taught based on their learning ability rather than by grade. 

Based on previous evidence from RCTs and Pratham's accumulated field experience from across India, intensive short burst ""learning camps"" with a duration of 10 to 20 days have emerged as a promising strategy since late 2011. The environment of the camp is different from normal teaching - more fun and participatory. In India, the idea of a ""learning camp"" is a new one. The potential of a learning camp to achieve several objectives is high, as it provides a dynamic demonstration of how visibly learning can change in a short period of time. Thus the learning camp has the chance of being a ""game changer"" as people, parents and teachers can see in front of their eyes and in their own village that change is possible without a huge amount of resources.

One month later, we offered the commitment product to a randomly chosen subset of 710 clients; 202 (28.4%) accepted the offer and opened the account. In the baseline survey, we asked hypothetical time discounting questions. Women who exhibited a lower discount rate for future relative to current trade-offs, and hence potentially have a preference for commitment, were indeed significantly more likely to open the commitment savings account.

See Section 3 of our (publicly available) pre-analysis document attached for more detail.,See Section 3 of our (publicly available) pre-analysis document attached.,"We anticipate that our job search interventions will have impacts on a number of job‐search behaviors, type of employment, duration of unemployment spells, and wages. However, finding full‐time,permanent and formal employment in Addis Ababa is challenging, and thus a change in this single binary outcome will likely be the most challenging impact to detect. Our study has been designed and the sample size chosen with the intention of having adequate power to detect this effect. Our power estimates should therefore be understood as the most conservative, lower bound estimates of the power of our design.

We calculate power through detailed simulation designs (corroborated with analytical results from comparable and simpler designs, run in the software package “Optimal Design”) in the presence of large spillovers (contamination) and possibly high intra‐cluster correlation (ICC) of up to 30%. ICC’s are introduced through the simulation of a cluster specific employment shock. In these “worst case scenarios”, we are able to detect a 5 ppt increase in the probability of employment on a baseline probability of 10% more than 80% of the time, with the size of the test at the 5% significance level. It should be noted that in the binary outcomes framework this effect is equivalent to a one sixth (1/6) standard deviation (sd) standardized effect size, much smaller than the usual rule of thumb of 0.2 sds suggested by Cohen (1998).

There are numerous ways in which we expect to have more power by looking at various other intermediate outcomes, or more easily influenced job‐market outcomes. Recall that the binary model estimates above could be estimated at each period in our high frequency data set, giving us the power to estimate detailed impact trajectories. However if we wanted to look at average outcomes over time we might have considerably more power from pooling all post‐treatment observations. As argued by McKenzie (2011), this is especially useful when outcomes of interest are measured with error or are weakly correlated over time, which could certainly be the case for temporary employment outcomes. When employment is relatively informal, wages and hours worked could be irregular and difficult to recall. At a single snapshot, treated individuals might not be significantly more likely to be employed, but the cumulative effect averaged over a few months might be significantly different."

We follow widely accepted medical guidelines and define hypertensive patients as those with systolic blood pressure above 140 or diastolic blood pressure above 90. To identify hypertensive individuals, a team of enumerators first screened all members of a particular household by measuring their blood pressure using an automatic blood pressure measurement device. If the systolic or diastolic blood pressure reading is above the thresholds previously described, the enumerator immediately invites the individual to participate in the study and to complete the baseline survey. In the event that more than one household member has hypertension, the member with the highest stage of hypertension (stage 1 or stage 2), is selected to take part in the study. Finally, in the event that more than one household member has the same hypertension stage, the member with the highest systolic blood pressure reading is selected to take part in the study.

Yet, data suggest that very few small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in low-income countries grow into larger businesses. Because SME owners often have limited human capital and lack management experience (Bruhn et al. 2012, Bloom et al. 2010, Drexler et al. 2011), many governments and development agencies invest in technical assistance programs aimed at training and mentoring entrepreneurs and helping SMEs to develop expansion strategies. However, little rigorous research exists on if and why these types of training programs are effective and whether they can be designed more efficiently to enable transformational entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation.

This evaluation assesses the impact of TechnoServe’s Women Mean Business program, which provides business skills training and mentoring to women entrepreneurs in Central Uganda. In addition to analyzing the direct impact of the training on recipient SMEs, we also examine the overall welfare effects on the community – a perspective that is needed to inform policymaking about SMEs but which is missing from most existing evaluations.

This study is a randomised control trial (RCT) evaluation of a preventative programme which aims to improve school readiness and life outcomes of socioeconomically disadvantaged children. The programme is operating in several disadvantaged communities in Dublin with above national average rates of unemployment, early school leavers, lone parent households and social housing.  The Preparing for Life (PFL) programme, which began in 2008, works with families from pregnancy until school entry in order to promote positive child development through improved parental behaviour and social support.

The programme is being evaluated using a mixed methods approach, incorporating a longitudinal experimental design and implementation analysis. The experimental component involves the random allocation of participants from the PFL communities to either the low or high treatment group for the duration of the programme. 

Who can participate? 
All pregnant women from the target communities in Dublin were eligible to participate. 233 pregnant were recruited into the PFL Programme between 2008 and 2010. Randomisation resulted in 115 participants assigned to the high treatment group and 118 participants assigned to the low treatment group. In addition, 99 pregnant women were recruited into a comparison group from comparable community. The population based recruitment rate was 52%.

What does the study involve? 
Preparing for Life provides a range of supports to participating families from pregnancy until school entry. The programme targets a range of child outcomes which are related to school readiness, including cognitive development, physical health and motor skills, socio-emotional development, behavioural skills, language development and emergent literacy. 

On recruitment during pregnancy, participants are randomly assigned to either a low treatment group or a high treatment group. Both the high and low treatment groups receive €100 worth of developmental toys annually and facilitated access to one year of high quality preschool.  In addition, the high treatment group receive two additional supports that are not available to the low treatment group. First, participants in the high treatment group receive a home-visiting mentoring support service. The aim of the home visits is to support and help the parents with key parenting issues. Secondly, participants in the high treatment group also participate in group parent training using the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme which aims to improve positive parenting in a group-based setting for eight consecutive weeks. 

The evaluation collects data from all three groups (high treatment, low treatment, comparison group) at baseline during pregnancy (t0), and when the child is six months (t1), 12 months (t2), 18 months (t3), 24 months (t4), three years (t5), and four years old (t6). A comprehensive set of data are collected at each point.

At each time point, we compare the outcomes of the high treatment group, low treatment and comparison groups.

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
If the programme is effective, families in the high treatment group may benefit from the programme by gaining greater parenting knowledge and skills; and their children will be better prepared for school.

Risks of participation are few.  The main risk is that some study questions are of a personal nature and may cause participant discomfort or stress.  Potential participants are informed as part of the consent process that participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study or decline to answer any question at any time without penalty.

Where is the study run from? 
The Evaluation of PFL is housed at the Geary Institute at University College Dublin in Dublin Ireland.

When is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? 
Recruitment took place from 2008 to 2010.  The evaluation continues until all children are 4 years of age, in March 2015.

Who is funding the study? 
The evaluation of the Preparing for Life programme is funded by the Northside Partnership through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies.

The study population consists of 600 market women in Tamale, Northern Ghana.  Several recent studies suggest that women similar to those in the study population are willing and able to save, but that they face challenges in reaching their savings goals.  Studies have also shown surprisingly large impacts from programs that facilitate savings.  The psychological literature suggests that habits guide the behaviour of many people, and that there is potential for habit formation to help people to reach goals that they find difficult, for example, because of self control problems.  While there are many ways to think about forming habits, most are information and time intensive.  Providing incentives for the repetitive performance of particular behaviours is among the cheapest and least information intensive options.  This work will explore three main issues:  first, can an experiment be designed that can discriminate between the two key possibility --  that incentives are sufficient to create a habit, or that incentives alone cannot create a habit; second, are incentive complementary to other potential avenues for promoting habits; third, what is the role of consistency and repetition in habit formation; and fourth, what population characteristics determine whether or not it is possible to form a habit?

Half the sample will be the treatment group, members of which will be provided with a savings incentive; the size of which will vary on a randomized basis.    The length of incentive provision will be determined by an endogenous measure of habit formation, which has been shown in past research to reach a maximum.  Incentives will be ceased when a pre-specified portion of the group has reached this maximum.    The remaining half will be control, and will receive no incentive.

There will also be additional cross-randomizations.  First, because we are concerned that the habit measurement amounts to a treatment, 75% of the control and 25% of the treatment will not receive this measurement.   Second, to validate the habit measurement, 33% of the treatment group will receive incentives for an additional 4 weeks, with treatment ceasing at the same time as teh main treatment group.  Theory suggests that these group should experience no additional propensity to form a habit.  Third, to assess the role of consistency in creating a habit, 33% of the treatment group will be subject to four weeks in which incentives will not be paid (although the total time period for which incentives are paid will remain the same).  These four weeks will be randomly allocated through the term of the incentives.  Finally, one quarter of all subjects receiving incentives will also be given some advice on how to effectively meet the savings requirements to receive the incentive.  This advice will be based  on a psychologically informed model of habit formation, which highlights that a savings habit requires the constant repetition of several sub-behaviors.  

Data will be collected weekly during the habit formation phase.  Baseline data will be collected at the time of the cessation of incentive payment, as well as 6 months post treatment, and at additional dates if effects are seen at 6 months.

For example, in 2009-10, 31\% of total bilateral aid by the OECD Development Assistance Committee's members were in support of gender equality, and approximately 10\% were in support of education (OECD, 2012). The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzay ""…for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education"" also emphasizes the importance of these two issues. It is generally assumed that by targeting women, their children will benefit. However, the evidence in the literature is mixed. In this project, we want to contribute to the literature by studying whether women invest more in their children than men do and what the potential reasons for this might be.

The research questions are the following:
1. Is child welfare influenced by whether additional resources to the household are allocated to women or men?
2. What are the underlying mechanisms determining resources spent on children in the household?

The results from the study will provide insights on both research questions and inform the development policy debate about how to strengthen child welfare. They will also contribute to the economic theoretical literature on household models.

Concerning the first research question, many studies have shown that there is a relationship between gender and household expenditures. To illustrate, in Kenya and Malawi, Kennedy and Peters (1992) find that female-headed households spend a larger share of total income on food and a smaller share on alcohol compared to male-headed households. Similarly, Hoddinott and Haddad (1995) use data from Côte d'Ivoire and find that when the female income share in the household is increased, the share of household income spent on food increases, and the share spent on alcohol and cigarettes decreases.

The assumption that women spend more resources on their children than men leads us to the second research question: What are the mechanisms determining the amount of resources spent on children? First, women and men may have different preferences. If women assign a higher weight to children's welfare in their utility function, they will allocate more resources to their children than men. Similarly, if women are more patient than men are, they will be more willing to invest in their children as this investment yields a long-term return. On the other hand, if women are more risk averse than men, they will be less willing to invest in their children than men as this investment is risky. Second, the difference might be due to bargaining power. Assume that women and men care equally much about their children. In a situation where the men have all the bargaining power and hence make all the decisions, they have to bear all the costs of investing in their children, whereas both adults in the household benefit. Increasing female bargaining power implies that the cost of investing in the child is split between the two adults, and the benefit remains the same for both. In this case, investment in children would increase (Basu, 2006). 

The theoretical framework of this project derives from household models. In the literature, household models are divided into two categories; unitary and non-unitary household models. In unitary household models, the household is considered as one unit maximizing a single utility function (Lundberg and Pollak, 1996. As this model has several limitations, we will focus on non-unitary household models. In particular, one cooperative model and one non-cooperative model. The cooperative model we use is the collective household model developed by Chiappori (1992) and Browning and Chiappori (1998). This approach relies on two assumptions; there exists a stable decision process  in the household and this process leads to Pareto-efficient outcomes (Browning, Chiappori and Weiss, 2014). By using this framework, Basu (2006) finds that children in a household is less likely to work if the power structure is balanced. The non-cooperative household model used in this project is developed by Browning and Lechene (2001). In this approach, agents chose their strategies simultaneously and independently. Each individual act as an independent agent conditional on the action of the other. In other words, the individual maximizes his or her utility subject to his or her budget constraint taking into account the actions of his or her spouse. The solutions need not be Pareto efficient (in the sense that it may be possible to improve the utility of one of the spouses without reducing the utility of the other spouse). In this case, going from a situation in which the woman has no bargaining power to a situation in which the woman has some bargaining power, will decrease investments in children.

To answer the research questions, we have designed a lab experiment to be conducted in the field in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We have invited married couples with at least one child of primary school age to the lab in July and August 2015. The experiment will consist of three parts. In the first part we elicit time and risk preferences (incentivized choices) to study whether men and women have different preferences for investing in children. In the second part of the experiment, the participant will make an incentivized distributive choice. The choice they make is an allocation between themself, their spouse and their child (1/3 of participants make this decision on their own, 1/3 bargain over the decision with their spouse and 1/3 simply observes their spouse's choice). The idea here is to experimentally vary female bargaining power to investigate whether an increase in female bargaining power causally changes how much is invested in the child. In the third part of the experiment, the participants will answer four non-incentivized questions about the decision-making in their household. These questions are intended to measure bargaining power within the household. In addition, before starting the experiment, the participants will answer a set of standard background questions.",2015-07-13,2015-08-14,Investments in children,"In the distributive phase, participants are asked to allocate Tsh 15,000 between themselves, their spouse and their child.

These questions will aid our understanding of differences in investments in children between treatments.","The present project uses a lab-in-the-field approach to collect experimental data. The experiment will be conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in July and August 2015.

Couples have been recruited in the relatively poor neighborhood (ward) Kawe in the Kinondoni municipal, situated in the north-east of the region. There are six primary schools in the area. In June 2015 we distributed an invitation letter to the student's parents. The invitation letters ask parents interested in participating in the study to fill out a form and return it to the head teacher. These forms will be used by local research assistants to contact the parents before the experiment.

The evaluation takes place in a country that performs at or near the bottom of 8th grade math performance in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) despite a relatively high level of public sector expenditure on education.  If successful, the intention is for Numeric to increase the scale of its after-school programs.

The evaluation will use creative maths testing procedures to overcome the oft-cited problem in education research of low-stakes assessment tests actually measuring motivation rather than ability.  The evaluation will also seek to identify the channels through which the program improves maths performance, thereby equipping education policymakers with valuable information on how to structure similar interventions.  Finally, the evaluation will measure impacts on non-math outcomes, including a measure of nonverbal cognitive ability and computer literacy.

We stratified the randomization by commune and used a re-randomization procedure to ensure balance on a number of village characteristics. Treatment villages were divided into catchment areas of about 15 villages each by OA/FFH and local partner NGOs. In the study area, each hired agent was assigned a catchment area and was instructed to target 10 villages in the first year of implementation (May 2009-April 2010). In the following year (May 2010-April 2011), hired agents continued to support villages targeted the first year and also introduced SfC in the remaining villages in their zone. During the third year (May 2011-April 2012), the number of hired agents decreased and the territories expanded somewhat. Hired agents continued to support existing replicating agents, added extra groups in neighborhoods of big villages/towns, and implemented follow-up to strengthen older groups.

In order to investigate the way in which the training method of the replicating agent affects program impacts, treatment villages within each catchment were randomly assigned to one of two replication types. Replicating agents in structured replication villages participated in a formal, three-day training. As part of the training, replicators received a pictorial guide and a certificate stating they are certified to form SfC groups. In organic replication villages, replicating agents were not provided with the formal training and material resources. Hired agents provided support (answering questions and giving advice) to replicating agents, whether in the structured or organic villages. Hired agents were instructed to target an equal number of villages from each replication type within the first year.

The policy reform proposes that all women have their NREGS wages deposited into individual bank accounts, instead of the status quo where wages are paid into a household bank account, typically owned by the male head. This reform has been proposed for India-wide rollout, but its impact on female welfare is theoretically ambiguous: the policy may improve women’s welfare if it increases women’s standing in the household or boosts financial empowerment. Alternatively, it could have unintended negative consequences such as increased domestic violence. The results from the field experiment will be used to estimate the net impact of this important policy change, and help Indian policymakers increase financial access for women in a gender-sensitive manner. Our primary outcomes of interest include a broad range of measures of female welfare and socioeconomic status, as well as measures of corruption and leakage within the NREGS system. The multi-treatment arm design of the research study will help provide evidence on the causal pathways that mediate the policy’s effect.

A large literature has documented the frequent absences of small scale farmers from their own field during the cropping season to engage in short-term ""ganyu"" labor outside of their households. Qualitative evidence suggests that the observed labor supply off-farm is neither planned nor desired by household, but rather a coping strategy employed by financially distressed households to overcome short-term credit constraints. However, research on the relationship between short-term credit constraints and labor supply is scarce. To identify the causal impact of short-term constraints on agricultural productivity through farms’ labor supply, we propose to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial, which will provide selected households with access to maize loans during the farming season. In the first year of the study, loan programs will be announced after cropping decisions are made. This will allow us to isolate short-run adjustment on the labor supply margin, and any resulting impact on agricultural productivity. During the second year of the study, the loans will be announced to a subset of farmers before cropping decisions are made. This will allow us to measure the combined effect of adjustments in the overall production plans as well as in the short-term labor allocation. In order to distinguish credit supply from basic income effects, income transfers corresponding to the net value of the credits will be made to a subgroup of farmers. We will also provide cash loans to a selected group of farmers to measure the impact of the in-kind nature of the loan programs on uptake, repayment, resource allocation, productivity and harvest outcomes. The tested interventions are easily scalable, and, if successful likely to be implemented both by government and non-government agencies.",2014-01-06,2015-06-30,The primary endpoint is total value of harvest produced by farms. Secondary outcomes are on-farm labor supply and nutrition.,"The primary question is whether access to loans can improve farm productivity, which we will measure as the total production value generated by each farm.

The main mechanisms through which we expect credit constraints to affect productivity is on-farm labor supply - which is therefore our secondary outcome.

Since short-term resources may also affect consumption and nutrition, we will analyze child nutrition as third outcome.","Clusters will be randomly assigned to cash loans, maize loans or control group.","In order to assess the effect of short-term credit constraints on labour allocation decisions, we propose to conduct a cluster-randomized trial. As part of the study, farmers will be allocated to 3 groups: a control group, a maize loan group, and a cash credit group. In the first year of the trial, credit interventions will not be announced until January, which is the beginning of the “hungry season” and, with the final harvest only 3 months away, the beginning of the most labour-intensive part of the farming season. At this point in the season, farmers have made their cropping decisions. The main objective of this first phase of the project is to assess the labour supply impact of short-term credit constraints, i.e. to assess the degree to which additional resources affect household labour allocation. The primary goal is to 1) measure the degree to which the elimination of credit constraints lowers the provision of off-farm labour, 2) increases the hiring of outside labour in the short-run, and 3) affects final harvest outcomes.

Maize loans will be offered in early January, and will give farmers the option to obtain one 50kg bag of maize per month from January to March. Since zero-interest loans constitute a net transfer to farms, we will provide direct income transfers to a subset of farmers. The comparison of farmers in main treatment groups with the subsample of farmers in the control group receiving direct income transfers will allow us to separate the credit access mechanisms from the direct income effect of the maize program.

While one of the innovation of the proposed study lies in the provision of food loans, the fundamental mechanism addressed in this proposal is the impact of short-term credit constraints on agricultural labor supply. The comparison between the control and the cash credit arm will allow us to directly assess the degree to which farming outcomes are affected by credit constraints. While we conjecture that maize loans will have a larger impact on farm productivity than cash loans, the relative difficulty of enforcing cash repayment is likely to affect both uptake and repayment rates, and thus also the relative feasibility of both programs. The parallel introduction of cash credits will allow us to directly assess these claims empirically, i.e. to assess whether maize is used differently from cash credit and if yes, which loan program compares more favorably with respect to final agricultural production.
While short-term increases in production are of interest, the most important question addressed in the proposed study is whether short-term improvements in yields can have persistent positive effects on agricultural productivity. Higher yields resulting from the intervention in Year I should lower the likelihood of households facing food shortages in the subsequent year. A very successful short-term intervention therefore has the potential to permanently alter household productivity. These effects may be even larger if farmers are aware of future credit options at the beginning of the farming season. The availability of credit during the farming season should, as outlined in the theoretical model above, alter farmer’s plot size and crop choices at the beginning of the season, and lead to larger overall adjustments. To distinguish wealth from anticipated credit access mechanisms, 50% of treated farmers will be offered a continuation of the loan programs in Phase II of the program, while 50% of farmers will not be offered any further loan options. We expect farmers who received a loan in Year I to be on average wealthier at the beginning of the second season. By comparing farmers with continued programs to farmers who no longer get the programs we will be able to identify the additional effects (and extensive margin adjustments) achieved by allowing farmers to adjust their production plan to newly available credit options before starting field operations. We will measure wages within the study villages and on nearby large farms to help identify more general labor market impacts.",Randomization will be done in office by a computer.,Cluster/ villages of farmers,180 farms,3600 farmers,"60 control, 60 cash loan, 60 maize loan",The study is powered to detect an increase in farm production value of 10% (ITT).

1.	Intellectual Merit
Type of Proposal: Full Research and Development
Strand: Scale-up & Sustainability

The Advanced Placement curriculum developed by the College Board aims to prepare high school students for the rigor of college coursework. In collaboration with NSF, the NRC, and educators across the nation, the Board is revising AP science courses to better develop students’ ability to conduct scientific inquiry. The revised courses emphasize depth of inquiry and application as opposed to the acquisition of limited knowledge in many content areas. The new courses in biology and chemistry will be launched in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The Board plans to provide supports to teachers to help them implement the new AP curricula, including online resources and community building activities.

The goals of our study are to conduct a formative and summative evaluation of the new curriculum and produce findings that can be used by the Board and educators to strengthen the teaching of advanced science courses in high school. We will recruit and provide resources to schools to launch a new inquiry-based AP Biology or Chemistry course, and randomly assign students within the recruited schools access to the newly-offered courses. To evaluate and improve the fidelity of AP course implementation, we will conduct surveys, interviews, and observations of teachers and students in the AP courses, and provide real-time feedback to educators.  Our summative evaluation will determine the effects of the scaled-up, inquiry-based curricula on students’ ability to conduct scientific inquiry and their overall educational performance and aspirations, including the number, quality, and type of colleges to which students apply and enroll. We will examine variation in the effects of the new courses according to students’ prior level of preparation and the level of fidelity with which the courses are implemented. 

2.	Broader Impact
The results of this study will impact schools’ willingness and capacity to offer AP and other college-level inquiry-based science courses and will enhance scholarship on the effects of inquiry-based science teaching and learning by:

(1)	providing evidence of the challenges and successes encountered by schools that expand access to rigorous inquiry-based science courses and to teachers who teach the courses to students with different levels of preparation;

(2)	providing estimates of the impact of taking these courses on students’ progress in higher educational attainment and continuation on the path to becoming future scientists and engineers; and

(3)	creating opportunities for regular communication between practitioners and researchers around implementation and program improvement, thus enhancing the infrastructure for research and education.

The results of this study will provide the first experimental evidence on the effects of taking an inquiry-based AP science course on students’ educational progress generally and their success in STEM fields in particular.  As there have been widespread federal and state policy efforts to increase the availability of AP courses and the number of students taking such courses, the results of this research will help inform such policy efforts in the future.

This is particularly unfortunate in a low-income context where pregnancy among young girls can result in illegal and often dangerous abortions, the spread of HIV/AIDS and, more generally, poor health, educational, and economic outcomes.

The present study takes place in Tanzania and investigates the fertility and economic decisions of girls when they are on the verge of making two of the most important decisions in their lives: what to do when leaving school and whether to start childbearing. 

The present project investigates whether early childbearing reflects a lack of empowerment among young girls in Tanzania, with a focus on two different empowerment strategies. First, we offer an information treatment where young girls are targeted with detailed and extensive information about reproductive health, gender equality, and rights. Second, we offer an opportunity treatment where young girls are targeted with entrepreneurship training to improve their skills on how to run a business. Both treatments aim at empowering girls, but through different channels. The information treatment represents in many ways the classical approach in the field, where the underlying idea is that teenage pregnancies reflect lack of relevant information and personal control. The opportunity treatment, on the other hand, investigates whether teenage pregnancies to a large extent reflect a lack of economic opportunities. By comparing these two treatments, the study will provide novel insights on the relative importance of providing information and opportunities to adolescent girls, which is important both from a theoretical and a policy perspective. In addition, since there may be important complementarities in how the two treatments work, we also offer a cross-treatment to a sub-sample of the girls. 

An ultimate goal of this research project is to inform the design of sound policies, and we are thus particularly careful to develop a cost-effective intervention with scaling-up potential: all treatments are evaluated and compared not only in terms of impact but also on their relative economic costs. The interventions are based on current practices of our partners, which makes it easier to scale up the successful parts of the project and, more generally, to use the knowledge from the project to improve existing policies.

Three dimensions, knowledge, behavior and gender-equality, are measured specifically for health and entrepreneursHIP, and thus we expect a stronger effect from the corresponding treatment intervention. The empowerment outcomes apply across health and entrepreneursHIP. In sum, we thus have seven outcomes in largely unrelated domains.

Knowledge:

K1 = knowledge in reproductive health.
We ask 7 incentivized questions about reproductive health (part 8 of the short-term follow-up questionnaire). In each question, the respondent must choose one among four possible answers. The outcome K1 is equal to the number of correct answers on these questions. Here and elsewhere we will also consider reporting the standardized outcome measure

K2 = knowledge related to business practices
We ask 5 incentivized questions about business (part 7 of the short-term follow-up questionnaire). In each question, the respondent must choose one among four possible answers. The outcome K2 is equal to the number of correct answers on these questions.


Behavior:

B1 = indicator of safe sex practices
This binary variable is equal to one if the respondent reports not having sex or using a condom when she has sex (which means reporting 5 or 6 in question 6.3.1 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire). 

B2 = current plans to open a business 
This binary variable is equal to one if the respondent reports already having made plans to open a business once the school year is completed (question 4.3 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire).

Gender equality

G1 = acceptance of gender-based violence
We ask the following question that comes from the DHS - Tanzania: “do you agree that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if  (answer YES or NO) (question 6.3.5 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire):
1)	she burns the food 
2)	she argues with him
3)	she goes out without telling him
4)	she neglects the children
5)	she refuses to have sexual intercourse with him”
G1 is constructed as in the DHS reports and is equal to the number of YES answers given by the respondent. 

G2 = acceptance of women’s higher earnings
We ask whether they agree that “it is acceptable to me that a wife earns more money than her husband” (question 5.2.6 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire). The response is on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disagrees and 5 is “strongly agrees”. G2 is equal to the response value.  This is question 5.2.6 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire.

Empowerment

E1 = willingness to compete
In an incentivized lab setting, E1 is a binary variable equal to one if the respondent chooses a competitive game rather than a fixed-payment game (question 9.2.4 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire).

E2 = Empowerment index
This index is constructed from the seven questions in 2.1 and 2.2 in the short-term follow-up questionnaire. Questions 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.4 are inverted so that in all questions, a lower score reflects a higher empowerment.
To examine the overall impact of the interventions on the empowerment index and to account for multiple hypotheses testing, we estimate the overall average treatment effect on the index. The overall average treatment effect is estimated by combining the effects on each of questions using the method of Kling and Liebman (2004) and Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007). We will also report the estimates on the individual questions.
","We sampled schools with at least 20 girls in Form IV in the following regions: Tabora, Singida, Morogoro and Dodoma. In each school, we did a baseline survey of the girls enrolled in Form IV and surveyed the headmaster of each school, who provided us with detailed information about school characteristics. 

The schools were then randomly allocated to the control group or one of the three treatments. The randomization was blocked by school-size (below or above 40 girls in Form IV) and by region.

After the baseline survey, one or two teachers per (treated) school attended a one week instructor session organized by Femina HIP (two weeks for the teachers involved in the combined treatment). After this instructor sessions, the teachers implemented the training sessions (treatments) with all the Form IV girls of their school. The single treatments had 8 training sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours, 1 session per week. The cross-treatments had 16 training sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours, two sessions per week. 

The short-term follow-up survey was done within six weeks after the last training session. The survey data was collected by the girls filling in a questionnaire in the classroom. In addition, we collected incentivized data on knowledge (i.e. the students received a payment for each correct answers) and their willingness to compete.

We also surveyed 5 boys in Form IV in each school to measure spill-over effects of the treatments.

In 2008, migrant remittances sent to developing countries amounted to US$338 billion, roughly three times larger than foreign aid flows. However, very little is known about how the development impact of these funds can be maximized. The hypothesis driving this research is that remittances may have greater long-run development impact when migrants sending these remittances are given more control and monitoring over how the funds are used by recipients. Surveys of migrants consistently find that education is among the most important categories of expenditures that migrants seek to fund in the home country. This project tests the impact of providing migrant workers with a better ability to control the use of remittances for education, and to monitor the educational performance of sponsored students. We will focus on overseas Filipino workers in Rome. In collaboration with a major Philippine bank remittance channel and a respected Philippine NGO with expertise in managing privately-funded educational scholarships, the principal investigators will evaluate demand for and the impact of a new educational payment and monitoring facility. 
This facility – dubbed EduPay – will provide overseas Filipinos with the ability to pay educational institutions in the Philippines directly from overseas, without channeling the funds through a relative or other “trustee”, and also provide information to the overseas migrant on the performance (attendance, grades) of the sponsored student.

In addition, it is important to examine changes in school attendance and performance of school-age individuals in the origin household. If migrants take up the new facilities but there is no effect on number of students sponsored or on schooling in the origin household, then this would suggest that the new facilities are simply more convenient ways to undertake payments and monitoring, and don’t help solve control problems. Evidence more consistent with the facilities solving control and monitoring problems would be that migrants sponsor more students and/or that schooling and performance rise in the origin household","A sample of Filipino migrants in Rome will be randomly chosen to be offered this product during the pilot phase,.

Lack of access to finance remains a core challenge to small firm growth in developing countries. Many SMEs have high returns to capital but if banks cannot identify those borrowers, they may restrict lending or misallocate funds, in turn limiting production and employment growth. Many developing countries do not have credit bureaus or other effective public systems that aggregate information valuable for screening, further exacerbating the challenge of identifying high return borrowers.  We evaluate a new credit scoring system implemented by the Development Bank of the Philippines to process its SME loans. The randomized design generates exogenous variation in access to credit among loan applicants, enabling us to measure the impact of credit on SMEs.  An important and innovative aspect of this evaluation is its focus on vertical and horizontal spillovers. Firms operate in a web of competitors and suppliers, and providing credit to a single business is likely to have spillover effects on other firms and on consumers.

Applicants whose scores fall in a pre-defined range just below the minimum score that automatically qualifies someone for a loan will be randomly assigned to either receive a loan or serve as part of the comparison group.  During the loan application process, information will be collected on the loan applicant's suppliers and competitors.  Those suppliers and competitors comprise the supplier and competitor samples, respectively, and data on those firms will be used to measure the indirect effects of access to credit for SMEs.

","Randomization occurs first at the branch-sector level and then at the firm level. At each branch, pre-selected industry sectors will be randomly assigned “targeted” or “non-targeted” status:

•	Targeted: In these sectors, we will intensively market the SME loan products to all firms in the catchment area of the bank branch, encouraging them to apply for credit. The third and subsequent applicants in the bubble from these sectors will be approved with 90% probability.
•	Non-targeted: These sectors will receive no specific marketing on loan products. The third and subsequent applicants in the bubble from non-targeted sectors will be approved with 10% probability.

Assignment of targeted status will be stratified by sector and branch, so that each sector has an equal number of branches in which it is targeted and non-targeted, and each branch has an equal number of targeted and non-targeted sectors. The mix of targeted and non-targeted sectors will be stratified to balance all permutations across branches.

One relatively simple policy that has the potential to increase incomes for certain types of workers is the provision of eyeglasses. Many adults in developing countries work in handicraft production, and many of them require adequate eyesight to produce handicraft items in sufficient quantity and quality. As these workers get older, their vision typically deteriorates. One common problem is hyperopia, which is more commonly called farsightedness. Older adults with hyperopia lose their ability to focus on objects that are very near to them. They lose their ability to read books and other documents and, more generally, experience a reduction in their ability to do any work for which they must focus on objects that are less than 1-2 meters from their eyes. Almost all types of hyperopia can be corrected with simple reading glasses, yet in many developing countries the use of any kind of eyeglasses is rare, especially among the poor. This randomized control trial (RCT) investigates the impact on worker productivity of providing reading glasses to adults who have developed hyperopia.

Three years after farmers received training, training did not increase household income or consumption. Training also did not affect mediating outcomes, such as adoption of agricultural practices or changes in cultivation of crops, which suggests that longer-term impacts are unlikely to materialize. Many farmers lacked the financial means to invest in the types of practices that were the focus of the curricula, and farmers were also often unwilling to try new crops that have higher up-front costs even if they are much more profitable in the long run. Our findings highlight the challenges that even a well-implemented training program has in spurring behavioral change among farmers and the challenges of providing effective services when foreign aid agencies prioritize having a large programmatic footprint.

In Benin, this is particularly the case and the national statistics agency estimated that the informal sector represented in 2009 up to 70% of the GDP and 95% of employment. This evaluation takes advantage of the creation of a new legal status for small firms by the Government of Benin to study the impact of three different packages of formalization incentives on formalization rate and firm performances. 3,600 informal businesses operating in Cotonou have been randomly allocated into three treatment and one control groups. A first treatment group will only receive information about the new status and the fact that direct and indirect costs of formalization have been highly reduced. A second group of businesses will receive the same information plus access to business training and bank services (access to a bank account) as further incentives to formalize. On a top of that, a last treatment group will have access to tax mediation services. The evaluation goal is to answer the following research questions (i) Do firms voluntarily move into the formal sector if costs of formalization are highly reduced? (ii) What is the optimal package of incentives to increase formalization? (iii) To what extent the fear of tax administration is an important barrier to formalization?

• What is the effect of becoming formal on firm performance and access to credit?

To do so, the evaluation will use a randomized control trial (RCT) methodology with a firm level randomization.
","1- Selection of the study population: 
In order to select the study population, a listing survey was conducted in Cotonou. This survey was designed in order to get a representative sample of all business operating in Cotonou including Dantokpa market (the largest market in Benin and one of the largest in West Africa). All firms with fixed location excepting international and nationwide companies were targeted. 7,945 businesses were successfully surveyed. 
A population of 3,600 businesses was then selected to participate to the study based on the following goals:
• Drop firms already formal.
• Drop firms that will probably not cooperate in the future or which will be probably difficult to find.
• Try to trim the database from (a) firms very close to formalization who would have formalize anyway and (b) firms very far from formalization which would not be interested by the program.
• Remove firms that will most probably not been interested.
• Reduce the standard deviation of the main outcomes (profit and sales).

The 3,600 firms selected for the study have very similar characteristics to the other informal firm not selected. It means that even with these selection criteria, the study kept a good external validity. 

2- Evaluation design
The 3,600 informal businesses were then randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups and one control group. Data collected during the listing survey on important firm characteristics were used for the stratification (see below for more details).
In Group 1, firms will only receive package A of incentives. That is only the information on the new status, on how to formalize and on tax system applicable to the new status.
In Group 2, firms will receive package A and package B of incentives. Thus these firms will receive package A and additional incentives to formalization like access to business trainings and services and support to open a bank account in a commercial bank.
In Group 3, firms will receive package A, package B and package C of incentives. So in addition to what will receive firms in group 2, they will also receive tax mediation services. 
In Group 0, firms will not receive any information or incentives. This group will serve as a control group.","The randomization was done in office using STATA. 
The following methodology was used for stratification: 
16 strata were created using the variables: Firm owner gender, firm operating in Dantokpa market, trader and firm owner a bank account. 
Then inside each stratum a Z-score was created as the average of standardized profit, sale and number of employee. Based on this Z-score, triplets of firms were created and inside each triplet, firms were randomly allocated to 3 groups: group 0, group ""1&2"", and group3. Each group included 1,200 firms.
Finally, the 1,200 firms in group ""1&2"" were randomly allocated into group 1 with 300 firms and group 2 with 900 firms.

Group 2 (packages A+B): 900 businesses
Group 3 (packages A+B+C): 900 businesses
Control group: 1200 businesses
","The sample size of 3,600 firms has been calculated to meet two goals: 
• High statistical power to detect small changes in formalization rates;
• Sufficient statistical power to analyze the effect of being formal on firm performances, assuming that the program has an effect on formalization (i.e., formal businesses increase at least by 25 percentage point).

Assuming that at most 10% of the businesses in the control group formalize during the study period, a sample size of 1,000 in each treatment group would give us a power of 91.3% to detect a 5 percentage point increase in the formalization rate. Our target is a 25 percentage point increase in formalization, in order to get sufficient take-up of formality and examine impacts of being formal on other firm outcomes.

It would also yield the same power to detect a 5 percentage point increase in the proportion of firms paying taxes or receiving a bank loan. To examine power for continuous outcomes like firm profitability, or amount of sales, we use the data collected during the listing/baseline survey. In this data, standard deviations of both profits and sales are equal to the mean. It means that if the treatment leads to a 25 percentage point increase in the formalization rate, with a baseline and two rounds of follow-up data, using ANCOVA, we will have 81.2% power to detect a 36% increase in firm profits from formalizing. 

The above power calculations assume a 100% take up rate and no attrition, but these assumptions may be unrealistic given the context. However, program take-up is likely to be very high because the organization in charge of the program is likely to be able to get in touch with most of the informal businesses to deliver the different treatments. If we expect to reach 95% of informal businesses with our intervention (the “take up-rate”), then we would need a sample of 1,108 in order to detect a 5 percentage points increase in formalization rates [1/(0.95)^2)*1000].

In addition, we may “lose” part of the sample due to attrition (i.e. businesses that we cannot survey during the follow-up surveys). We think that we will be able to keep the attrition rate below 10% (since we are only targeting businesses with a fixed location it seems a realistic assumption). 

With 10% attrition and a take-up rate of 95%, we get our sample size of 1,200 informal businesses in each of the three groups, two treatment groups and one control (and one treatment group further split in two sets of 300 and 900 businesses), for a total number of 3,600 informal businesses.

Performance bonuses for clinical quality hold some promise for better aligning physician incentives with patient needs.  Moreover, directly rewarding lower rates of adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes flexibly identifies a socially desirable outcome without rigidly prescribing how it should be achieved – allowing local providers to use their local knowledge of what health improvement strategies are likely to work best.

This research follows a large sample of girls from 460 communities in rural Bangladesh who were exposed to a large scale empowerment program run by Save the Children. Beginning in 2007, girls in randomly selected communities received social competency, financial literacy and livelihood training designed to help them negotiate for their own needs and provide the basis for successful future economic empowerment. Others received a non-cash incentive to delay marriage until age 18, with the potential to significantly change marriage outcomes, including decision-making power dynamics between women, their husbands and in-laws.

Following Benjamin et al (2010), caste or gender will be primed by administering a questionnaire that asks questions related to the individual’s caste (or gender) identity. In the groups where identity is not manipulated, a neutral questionnaire will be administered. 

The experiment will be implemented over multiple “periods” across two months, where each period is about ten days long, during which the NGO will conduct extra Math classes at school. A “goal” (related to test scores and homework completion in the Math class) will be set and beliefs will be elicited at the beginning of each period, followed by a test after about a week/ten days. Subjects will receive test scores, followed immediately by goal setting (and elicited beliefs) for the next test.

The evaluation is a collaborative effort between Innovations for Poverty Action and researchers from multiple institutions, and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (DFID). The AHME intervention package will seek to improve efficiencies in private health care delivery by reducing both supply-side and demand-side constraints. Specifically, supply-side intervention will include (1) the social franchising of private clinics in order to improve consistency and quality of care and to reduce costs and (2) quality monitoring linked to capital financing in order to help clinics expand and improve clinical services. On the demand side, AHME interventions, such as vouchers, health insurance schemes and medical savings accounts will be integrated into the AHME package in later years to reduce financial barriers to accessing provider services. In addition opportunities to improve the operational efficiency of supply and/or demand-side financing interventions using information and communication technology (ICT) interventions will be explored. 

The AHME intervention package will be evaluated using a randomized control trial (RCT) design. The RCT will be designed to measure the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the AHME model (franchising, supply-side financing and demand-side financing) at improving quality of care, service utilization, access to high-quality care, and health outcomes. Clinics will be screened for eligibility during baseline data collection. Using criteria established by the AHME implementing partners, clinics will be grouped by how likely they are to be eligible for the AHME package of interventions. Clinics in top eligibility tiers (those most likely to be eligible for the package of AHME interventions) will be randomly assigned a number to determine the order in which they will be approached for recruitment into AHME. Random assignment will be stratified by county and eligibility tier. The top half of the list will be assigned to the treatment group (clinics that should be approached for recruitment to the AHME package immediately) and the control group (clinics that will be recruited after the completion of the AHME evaluation). The random number assigned to each clinic will also determine the order in which clinics will be approached within both treatment and controls arms. Subsequent interventions (i.e., demand-side financing and information and communication technology interventions) will be randomly allocated in a similar fashion. Data will be collected over a 4 year period at both the clinic and household level to measure healthcare utilization and quality of care, clinic financial outcomes, and child health outcomes. Outcomes will be compared between treatment and control clinics to estimate impacts of the overall AHME package. Cost-effectiveness analyses will also conducted






",2014-10-16,2017-10-31,"The key outcomes of interest will be: (1) provider quality, (2) cost of care (the amount that is charged for services, the share of patients that receive discounts and the cost of care, including cost of services, travel and medicines, etc., reported by patients in the household survey), (3) client load by service categories, (4) patient utilization through self-reported care-seeking behavior in the household survey, (5) facilities’ revenues and costs, (6) management practices (record-keeping, supply-chain management practices, human resource management practices, etc.), and (7) integration with financial institutions (access to formal loans and collaboration with insurance providers) and (8) market impacts. While we are not powered to measure child health impacts, we will also collect health outcomes among children <5 years in households that accessed clinics services during baseline. Health outcomes will include: summary health measures such as weight-for-height, height-for-age and mid upper arm circumference; self-reported symptoms for diarrhea, acute respiratory illness, and malaria; in addition, health measures may include assessment of anemia using a finger prick test for hemoglobin and RDTs for malaria. ","A note on facility quality:
Facility quality will be measured along several dimensions, including: (1) structural quality (e.g. hand-washing stations, proper storage of medicines, etc.), (2) provider knowledge of appropriate clinical practices for key disease areas prioritized by AHME (measured through medical vignettes, or hypothetical medical cases, in which providers say what actions they would take), and (3) provider adherence to appropriate clinical protocols in these disease areas (most likely to be measured through direct observation). 

Client perception of quality (e.g., general perceptions of quality, whether they were treated nicely, whether they waited long for service, etc.) and client-reported adherence to appropriate clinical protocols (measured by asking about provider actions taken during visits) will be measured in the household survey.

A note on market impacts:
Market impacts will be measured by (1) entry and exit of competitors to the clinics in the evaluation sample and (2) patient switching patterns. To measure entry and exit, the research team will map out all providers within a certain distance of treatment and control providers and will collect the name and location of other facilities used by households in our survey in order to identify competitors to clinics in the evaluation sample. In follow-up rounds of the survey, we will again map the area and measure entry and exit of competitors. We will measure switching patterns among current patients (patients that began using clinics prior to the introduction of AHME) during follow-up rounds of the household survey. We will also refresh the household sample in each of the follow up surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016. We will ask new clients about their care-seeking behavior prior to visiting the clinic of interest in the evaluation sample (if they sought care before and where if so). As a result, we will be able to determine whether new clients are switching from public facilities, switching from other private facilities or entering the healthcare system for the first time.
","The overall impact of the AHME package of interventions will be estimated using a randomized control trial design (RCT). During baseline data collection, clinics in counties throughout Eastern and Western Kenya will be mapped and screened by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), using established MSI and PSI criteria and protocols. Clinics that are considered ""likely"" to be eligible are assigned a randomly generated number by the investigators in order to 1) assign clinics to intervention (early recruitment), or control (recruitment at the end of the study) and 2) determine the sequence in which clinics are approached to be recruited for franchising and SafeCare/Medical Credit Fund by the implementation partners. In Year 1, after baseline clinic data collection, and randomization are complete, MSI and PSI will approach clinics for final determination of franchise eligibility and for recruitment. SafeCare/MCF interventions will also be rolled out in Year 1 as part of the AHME package and will follow the same recruitment order as that used for franchising recruitment.  In Year 2, treated clinics will receive demand-side financing interventions when PSI and MSI provide training and support to their franchised clinics to register with NHIF and to improve clients’ experience in using NHIF at their clinics. 

Four rounds of data collection will be used to measure baseline characteristics, and evaluation outcomes. In Year 1 (Q4: 2013) baseline surveys will be conducted in all clinics. In addition, clinic exit surveys will be used to identify and collect contact information from a sample of clinic clientele, and ask permission to visit their homes to conduct a baseline household interview.  In Year 2 (Q1: 2015), follow up surveys will be conducted in all clinics to measure intermediate clinic outcomes, and to monitor intervention implementation. In Years 3 and 4 (Q1: 2016; Q1: 2017) full follow ups surveys will be conducted in all clinics and all households to measure longer-term impacts of the AHME package and to measure incremental impacts of DSF and ICT interventions. 

This randomized design will allow us to directly compare outcomes in the intervention and control arms, and identify the effect of the intervention. Since not all clinics will agree to be franchised, or participate in SafeCare/MCF, intention-to-treat (ITT) principles will used to identify an unbiased effect of offering the package to the clinic. The effect of the treatment on the treated will be estimated by using an instrumental variables approach. In addition, randomizing the order in which clinics are approached for the intervention packages will allow us to estimate ""dose responses"", as different clinics will be on treatment for different amounts of time at each follow up round.  ","","Clinics will be assigned a random number between 0 and 1 by an investigator (STATA 13). A clinic’s random number will determine the order in which clinics will be visited for recruitment to AHME and whether a clinic is assigned to treatment or control. Clinics in the top half of the visit order list are assigned to the treatment group and will be recruited for AHME immediately,  and clinics in the bottom half of the visit order list are assigned to the control group and will be visited only after the study is complete. 

Randomization will be stratified by clinic size, eligibility tier and county. All clinics that are alone in their strata (for example, if there is only 1 medium-size clinic in the highest eligibility tier in a given county) will instead be stratified by size, eligibility tier and by region (Eastern or Western Kenya) rather than by county. 

Within the treatment group, the AHME implementing partners will visit clinics according to (1) “how eligible” they are (i.e. clinics that meet all of the eligibility criteria are visited first, those that meet most of the criteria are visited next, those that meet fewer of the criteria are visited third, etc.) and (2) the order determined by the random number initially assigned to each clinic. 
",Randomization will occur at the individual clinic level; households will be sampled from and clustered at the clinic level.  ,"The final sample size is to be determined. As of January 2014, we have randomized 1,528 clinics into the treatment arm and 1,475 clinics into the control arm.

The precise eligibility level at which we will cut clinics from the sample is to be determined. We anticipate the final clinic sample size to be between 800 and 1,200 clinics, with roughly half of the clinics in treatment and half in control.

In particular, we propose to study the dissemination of biochar (a soil amendment made from thermally altered biomass, including crop residues).   

A growing body of work has shown that biochar can improve crop yields and sequester carbon for long periods, particularly in highly weathered soils, such as those typical of much of sub-Saharan Africa.  However, numerous new agricultural technologies in sub-Saharan Africa have been introduced only to face lack of adoption by intended end-users.  This is particularly true among the subset of agricultural technologies that offer both local and global environmental benefits, that external actors may have an incentive to support through, for example, carbon finance.  

Therefore, our aims are threefold:  First, we seek to estimate the impact of biochar adoption on farm-level crop yields and profitability.  Second, we seek to test various inducement programs to see which is most effective in stimulating adoption of our new technology per dollar of external support.  In particular, we will compare the efficacy of a program to stimulate social learning through pre-existing social networks, a simple price support, and the provision of a limited liability credit offer.

Advice can increase productivity, drive sales and improve the chance of survival in tough economic times.
Yet as many as three in every ten small businesses in the UK may have an unmet need for business advice . And to date, available evidence does not establish a causal link between business advice and higher growth for small businesses. 
The Growth Vouchers programme is a pioneering government research project that aims to make it easier for small businesses to access expert advice to help them grow and test which types of business advice are most effective.  
The Growth Vouchers programme will run until March 2015 to attract around 20,000 small businesses that do not normally use advice. Vouchers worth up to £2,000 each will be given to a majority of the small businesses who take part to help them pay for advice. 
This programme will operate as a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), which will enable the government to obtain a robust assessment of the impact of different types of advice on participating businesses. RCTs are widely regarded as the gold standard for empirical research and are used extensively in medicine and international development. This is the first time that an RCT has been run on this scale to explore what business advice works best. 
The Growth Vouchers programme will produce real and comprehensive evidence, while providing benefits for the businesses who take part. This evidence will be used to inform future policy. 
This document sets out how the Growth Vouchers programme will operate, how its design satisfies the principles of running an RCT and the key questions that we aim to answer. It then explains what data and analysis will be done to arrive at an answer and the technical constraints on how robust our answers may be.  
",2014-01-28,2015-04-01,Firm Turnover,"","There are three main treatments in this RCT:  
•	Personal business advice assessment
•	Online business advice assessment
•	Growth Vouchers
As shown above, all businesses will be sent to the online marketplace.
Treatment allocations map onto the journeys that a business might take through the Growth Vouchers programme.  
Personal business advice assessment
This is an in-depth assessment conducted with the help of an expert business adviser. Assessments will mostly take place face-to-face but are also available over the telephone and via online voice or video calls. 
Businesses will be able to discuss their plans for growth, current concerns about strategy and so on. They then agree which area of advice is most important for them with their adviser. Advisors will write up an action plan that notes which area of advice was agreed and details some specific next steps. 
The personal business advice assessment is designed to give real value to small businesses, even if they do not receive a Growth Voucher.
Businesses can choose from one of five geographical regions in England, in order to identify the appropriate regional delivery partner for their assessment. Businesses may then contact their delivery partner directly or wait to be contacted in order to arrange an appointment. 
All businesses will be offered an appointment within two weeks of completing their application for the programme.  
Online business advice assessment
This is a simple, online questionnaire that was developed in conjunction with a number of leading national professional bodies. The questions cover all five areas of advice, so that businesses fully consider the options available to them. 
On completing the questionnaire, businesses will receive a recommendation on the area of advice best suited to them. This recommendation is not be prescriptive – each business may choose to accept it or select a different area of advice. 
Businesses will access the online business advice assessment directly after confirmation that they are eligible to participate in the Growth Vouchers programme. Alternatively, it is accessible via a link that will be emailed to a business should it prefer to complete the assessment later on.
Growth Vouchers 
Businesses may use a Growth Vouchers to claim up to 50% of the cost of any strategic advice, up to a value of £2,000 (non-inclusive of VAT). 
There are effectively five types of Growth Voucher, each valid for only one area of advice: 
•	Growth Voucher for: raising finance and managing cash flow
•	Growth Voucher for: marketing, attracting and keeping customers
•	Growth Voucher for: making the most of digital technology
•	Growth Voucher for: improving leadership and management skills
•	Growth Voucher for: recruiting and developing your staff
That is why Growth Vouchers are only allocated to a business after it selects an area of advice. 
This sequencing and the fact that Growth Vouchers are valid for only one area or advice means that we can analyse whether subsiding advice in one area or another results in a greater return on investment. This is in addition to analysing the impact of offering Growth Vouchers overall. 
Vouchers may be spent only with accredited suppliers for the Growth Vouchers programme. All such suppliers will be registered on the online marketplace hosted by Enterprise Nation. 
To note, businesses that are not given a Growth Voucher will also be directed to the online marketplace but will not receive a subsidy for any advice they purchase.  
Online Marketplace	
The online marketplace has been developed by the private sector and is hosted by Enterprise Nation. Hundreds of accredited, expert suppliers will be listed and easily identifiable by the Growth Vouchers logo pinned to their profile. 
Businesses will use this portal to identify an appropriate supplier of advice in their specific area. The marketplace cannot be used to process any transactions: businesses will need to contact suppliers themselves, agree a level of advice and arrange to receive it, pay the supplier and then claim their subsidy by redeeming their Growth Voucher. 
Businesses will be encouraged to leave feedback on their chosen supplier, which should help others judge whether a given supplier is likely to offer a good service and value for money.

Research has demonstrated that handwashing with soap prevents pneumonia and diarrhea, but lack of soap provisions and limited piped water infrastructure makes handwashing practices difficult. To make the process of handwashing more convenient, Innovations for Poverty Action has redesigned an existing tippy-tap handwashing system to create a more functional, durable, and innovative handwashing system. The result is a water-efficient, soap-frugal handwashing station that is portable and adaptable to multiple settings. The innovative soap foam dispenser conserves soap by dispensing tactile foam and the water tap is easy to use and conserves water.

This study will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the redesigned handwashing system when coupled with a handwashing behavioral intervention in peri-urban primary schools in Kisumu, Kenya. Using a cluster-randomized trial approach that incorporates a stepped wedge design, the study seeks to understand usage and maintenance practices related the handwashing stations in primary schools in comparison to existing handwashing practices.

Schools that agree to participate in the study will receive the handwashing stations and behavior change intervention sequentially in random order until all schools have received the intervention. The stepped-wedge design will ensure that all schools eventually benefit from the intervention. The design was chosen as hygiene interventions have been shown to do more good than harm, thus it will be more ethical to ensure that all schools selected for the study eventually benefit from the intervention rather than doing nothing in control schools (Brown and Lilford, 2006). This approach will also allow a robust comparison of the effects of the intervention on handwashing behavior among schools with and without exposure to the intervention.
Based on logistical consideration and budgetary implications, we will randomly select 30 schools and divide the schools into 3 groups of 10 schools each.  After baseline data collection in all schools at the beginning of the study, the intervention will be initiated in successive groups. Group 1 will receive the intervention during weeks 6-7, Group 2 during weeks 14-15, and Group 3 during weeks 22-23. Follow-up data collection will occur every 2 weeks at all schools during weeks 1-35. After week 35, follow-up data collection will be done every 6 months until month 24. Data collection activities will include interviews with the Head Teacher and WASH Teacher (a teacher dedicated to water, sanitation, and hygiene activities at the school), interviews with selected students in charge of the handwashing stations, rapid observations of water sources and handwashing stations, and structured observations of handwashing behavior.

Practices that met minimum EHR use requirements received payments on a graduated scale, increasing for more use of EHR functions. 

The demonstration was implemented in four sites, targeting practices with 20 or fewer providers supplying primary care to at least 50 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The demonstration was expected to operate for five years (June 1, 2009–May 31, 2014), but was cancelled in August 2011 because 43% of the practices did not meet program requirements. The evaluation used a stratified, experimental design—412 treatment and 413 control practices—to estimate the impacts of the payments on adoption and use of EHR functionalities. 

In June 2011, treatment group practices were, on average, 9 to 18 percentage points more likely than control group practices to report using 13 EHR functionalities queried at baseline (2008). The payments increased a summary score of EHR use, which ranged from 1 to 100, by more than 11 points on average relative to the control group (54 versus 43). 

Moderate incentive payments did not lead to universal EHR adoption and use in a two-year time frame. However, the demonstration showed that incentives can influence physician use of EHRs. These results are encouraging regarding the potential effectiveness of the EHR Medicare Incentive Program but also suggest that meaningful use of EHRs on a national scale may take longer than anticipated. 
",2009-06-01,2011-08-01,"Key measures for the evaluation were practices’ adoption and use of EHRs and other health IT, and a summary (composite) score that quantifies EHR use for the calculation of the incentive payment, which were drawn from a web-based Office Systems Survey (OSS).  Specific outcomes were:

- Any EHR/Health IT Use
- Electronic Patient Problem Lists
- Automated Patient-Specific Alterts and Reminders

* Completeness of information in the EHR
* Communication of care outside the practice
* Clinical decision support
* Increasing patient engagement
* Medication safety
","In order to calculate EHR summary scores for practices that used a certified EHR, the Office Systems Survey (OSS) measured 53 functions (for example, prescribing medications, ordering laboratory tests and other procedures, and care management and coordination) that are thought to be connected to improved care, although a causative link is  not yet empirically proven for many. These functions were sorted into five domains:  completeness of information, communication about care outside the practice, clinical decision support, increasing patient engagement, and medication safety. If practices were to use all 53 functions for three-fourths or more of their patients, the total composite score would equal 100. In addition to calculating this score, composite scores were calculated for the five OSS domains.  (Baseline scores cannot be estimated because application data on EHR/other health IT use are only available for 13 of the 53 functions.) Based on the total composite score for each treatment practice, CMS calculated payments during each demonstration year. Practices received their payments in the fall following the end of each demonstration year."," The EHRD evaluation used a stratified, experimental design to allocate 825 eligible practices that volunteered for the EHRD to treatment and control groups. This design was used to achieve balance on practice characteristics that are important predictors of adoption and use of electronic health records systems. In February 2009, practices from the four sites (Louisiana, Maryland/DC, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota) were randomized in equal proportions into treatment and control practices within strata, defined by site, number of primary care physicians, and whether the practice was in a medically underserved area. ","All randomized practices were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Using data from all practices that completed the 2011 Office Systems Survey (OSS), treatment-control differences in any EHR/health IT use and use of each of the 13 EHR functions were estimated using separate regressions. A similar analysis was conducted for the overall OSS summary score and the five OSS domain scores. The regressions adjusted for the stratifying variables and the baseline measure of the 13 functions. Inclusion of these variables adjusts for any differences between treatment and control groups due to survey non-response. Observations were weighted to adjust for survey nonresponse and non-random demonstration attrition. Sensitivity tests were conducted to confirm that the results were similar in regressions that did not use baseline control variables and in regressions that did not use weights.

Managerial capital refers to the skills associated with the management of customers, money, operations and people within businesses (Bruhn, Karlan and Schoar 2010).  Improvements in managerial capital offer the possibility of improved growth and prosperity.  However, there exists substantial evidence that it is not abundant among micro and small businesses – and those in developing countries in particular.  The limited empirical work that has used experimental interventions to improve managerial capital has been inconclusive as to whether such interventions have an impact on firm growth, job creation or poverty alleviation.  One potential issue is that existing studies typically involve offering business skills training to a broad mix of entrepreneurs, the majority of whom are self-employed out of necessity and would prefer jobs in the formal sector (i.e., subsistence entrepreneurs).  Greater selectivity in the recruitment of candidates for management skills training might offer greater potential for impact.  Prior training interventions have also tended to focus on building finance and accounting skills, which can lead to improvements in bottom-line profits.  Little emphasis has been placed on the development of marketing and sales skills, which have the potential to increase top-line revenues and, in turn, stimulate firm growth and job creation.

We seek to address these limitations by focusing on a more homogeneous group of firms, using a more intense intervention, and providing training programs that focus on only one dimension of managerial capital per course.  In part 1, a screening tool will be implemented to identify a homogenous sample of 900 ‘high growth potential’ micro and small enterprises in five locations across the greater Cape Town area of South Africa.  Next, in part 2, participants will be exposed to a high quality training intervention.  The mini-MBA training programs are provided by Business Bridge and combine online e-learning content with face-to-face classroom teaching sessions in an innovative approach that reduces dropouts, enhances learning, and improves real-world implementation.  The course structure also allows us to study the impact of providing ‘specific’ business skills training programs (e.g. marketing skills versus finance skills) as opposed to more general business training.  Participants will be randomly assigned into one of three groups.  300 participants will receive the “Marketing and Sales training” intervention through an 8-week intensive course that covers topics such as value creation, customer segmentation, pricing, competitive differentiation, and selling strategies.  300 participants will receive the “Finance and Accounting training” intervention that includes classes on separation of personal and business finances, cash-flow management, business investments, and record keeping (e.g. income statements, balance sheets, etc).  300 participants will be assigned to a control group that does not receive any training but can continue to use the services of our local partner.  Prior to the training program launch, a baseline survey will be conducted on all entrepreneurs in the sample (n=900).  Following the training, all participants will have their business practices and performance outcomes measured using post-intervention surveys over the next year.

Through this research, we hope to offer insights on how transformational entrepreneurs can be identified and nurtured.  We also hope to learn more about the extent to which the effects of managerial capital development depend on the specific training received (marketing vs. finance) and firm size (micro vs. small).  In addition, examining the interaction of marketing or finance skills with various individual background characteristics can provide further insights on who benefits more from different types of managerial capital programs.

Measuring the Unmeasured: Combining Technology and Survey Design to Filter Noise in Self-Reported Business Outcomes,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/251,"July 11, 2014",2014-02-12 12:47:17 -0500,AEARCTR-0000251,"Stephen Anderson-Macdonald, sjam@london.edu",on_going,2013-10-07,2014-12-01,"[""finance"", ""labor"", """"]","","Reducing noise and improving the measurement of business outcomes is critical to advancing research on private enterprise in low-income countries, particularly given the lack of record keeping (by entrepreneurs) and administrative data (by governments).  To address many of the outstanding measurement challenges we have constructed an electronic survey tool that brings together the benefits of the latest surveying technologies with improvements in survey design to increase the precision of profit and sales estimates obtained through research on micro enterprises in low-income countries.  We have identified four sources of noise, both in the literature and through our own research, which we will address through our new electronic surveying approach (e.g. respondent, business, surveyor and data management factors).  By focusing on survey design and technology, our novel approach represents a first attempt at reconciling the recommendations of de Mel et al (2009) for increased attention to survey design, with those of Fafchamps et al (2012) for identifying ways to leverage an electronic survey tool beyond basic consistency checks.

Specifically, our new electronic survey tool is designed to improve the collection of data on three sections of a firm’s financials: (1) Money In; (2) Money Out; and (3) Money Left-Over.  Through an iterative process, our electronic survey tool narrows in on a more precise estimate for firm sales, firm costs, and firm profits.  Moreover, by default the electronic tool offers certain advantages (over a similar paper survey tool).

To test whether our new approach does a better job of filtering out noise and increasing measurement precision, we will conduct a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a traditional paper survey tool compared to our new electronic survey tool.  Our proposed study will include an independent sample of micro entrepreneurs from Ghana.  The RCT will be carried out by the field research staff of Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) in 2014.  In Part 1, we will identify a sample of 600 micro entrepreneurs (50% female) operating their business in greater Accra.  In Part 2, we will randomly assign half of the entrepreneurs into a treatment group (administered our new electronic survey tool) and half into a control group (administered a comparable paper survey tool).  This field experiment will result in the construction of a novel dataset.
",2013-10-07,2013-12-20,"Our analysis will evaluate whether the new electronic surveying approach works better and, if so, then how it actually helps to improve the precision of estimates.  Outcomes to be examined include the coefficient of variation (CV) for each estimate, as well as the adjustment factor (AF) within each estimate (i.e. the extent to which an estimate changes from its pre-adjusted initial value to its post-adjusted final value).  For example, the difference between a pre-adjusted estimate for monthly profits (straight, unaided recall) and the post-adjusted estimate for monthly profits (obtained through the steps in the electronic survey tool).

Importantly, we will be able to compare each post-adjusted estimate obtained using our electronic tool to multiple benchmarks:
(1) Within tool:  CV of post-adjusted estimates (electronic tool) versus CV of pre-adjusted estimates (electronic tool).
(2) Between tools:  CV of post-adjusted estimates (electronic tool) versus CV of post-adjusted estimates (paper tool).
(3) Between tools:  AF of estimates (electronic tool) versus AF of estimates (paper tool).

In sum, we aim to examine whether sources of noise can be reduced and precision increased for profit and sales estimates of micro enterprises by using an electronic surveying approach that focuses on new triangulation, aggregation and adjustment processes in survey design.","","Our proposed study will include an independent sample of micro entrepreneurs from Ghana (n=600).

In Part 2, we will randomly assign half of the entrepreneurs into a treatment group (administered our new electronic survey tool) and half into a control group (administered a comparable paper survey tool).  

Importantly, all members of the survey team will be trained for 3 weeks by IPA research managers.  Each surveyor will implement the electronic tool (treatment group) or the paper tool (control group) to a participant on a randomized basis (supervised by IPA staff).  We will control for individual surveyor fixed effects in our analysis.  Thus, any differences between the two survey approaches (electronic versus paper) will be attributable to the survey design - and not to potential surveyor biases or training effects.

• Has >=5 outpatient medications
• Has difficulty accessing services
• Lacks social support
• Has a mental health co-morbidity

Another 180-day outcome where we would have the power to detect a 30% decline is the likelihood of 2 or more “hospital visits”, defined as outpatient ED visits plus inpatient readmissions, which averages 0.32. Other 180-day outcomes where we have the power to detect a 20% change include any hospital visit (an outcome that averages 0.54) and the likelihood of any outpatient ED visit (an average of 0.42).

","","The experiment took place in 40 villages across five aimags (provinces) in northern Mongolia. The experiment started in February 2008 when XacBank loan officers and representatives of the Mongolian Women's Federation (MWF) organized information sessions in all 40 villages. After about 30 women had signed up in each village and had declared their interest in receiving a loan, a detailed baseline survey was administered during the second and third week of March 2008. The total number of women interviewed was 1,148. The face-to-face interviews were conducted by a specialized survey firm hired by the research team and independent of XacBank. At the time of the baseline survey we also collected information on the main socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of the 40 villages. Randomization took place after completion of the baseline survey so that at the time of the interview respondents did not know whether they would be offered a group loan, an individual loan, or no loan at all. Village-level randomization was performed in a central location, using a random number generator in Stata, as decentralized and public randomization was not feasible given that the villages were spread over a large geographical territory. Randomization across rather than within villages was chosen because it was administratively and politically easier to manage. We stratified at the province level. After randomization, group formation proceeded in the 15 group-lending villages, but not in the individual-lending and control villages. Group formation consisted of the development of internal procedures, the election of a group leader, and the signing of a group charter. Groups were formed by the women themselves not by XacBank. A maximum of two women per group were allowed to be from the same family. After a group had collected enough internal savings it could apply for its first XacBank loan. The treatment period during which XacBank provided loans in the group and individual-lending villages lasted 1.5 years - from March 2008 to September 2009. During this period participating women in treatment villages could apply for (repeat) loans. In October 2009 we conducted a follow-up survey to measure again the poverty status and economic activity of the participating women. At this time, we also conducted a second village-level survey to collect information on village characteristics that may have changed, such as the prices of important consumer goods. XacBank collected repayment information on all loans for the entire period March 2008-June 2011.

During these sessions officers were instructed how to identify clients they would normally reject, but to whom they would consider lending if they were to accept slightly more risk. Once all officers were trained, and following a pilot in November 2008 in two branches in Gradačac and Bijeljina, the experiment was rolled out two months later to all 14 branches of our MFI. Loan officers were now asked to start identifying potential marginal clients from the population of loan applicants over a period of several months, until the desired sample size was achieved. Once a loan officer identified a potential marginal client, and following a short vetting process by the loan committee, the potential client was told that although he or she would normally not qualify for a loan, our MFI was reviewing its policies and as a result could offer a 50 percent chance of a loan provided that the applicant would agree to participate in a survey now and in a year's time. The loan officer also explained that the MFI would use the results of the study to decide how best to expand lending to this new client group on a permanent basis, meaning that marginal clients could continue to borrow as regular ones. This process continued until a total of 1,241 marginal applications were submitted to the loan committee. In total 1,196 of these marginal loan applicants were approved and interviewed. The interview lasted around 60 minutes and was conducted by a professional survey company using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). This baseline survey was conducted after the individual was judged to be eligible for participation in the program but before the randomization. At the end of each week, the research team in London would use a random number generator to allocate newly interviewed applicants with a 50 percent probability to either the treatment (receiving a loan) or the control group (no loan). Successful applicants received the loan within a week. Applicants allocated to the control group did not receive a loan from our MFI for the duration of the study. The last interview and loan disbursal took place in May 2009. During February-July 2010, 14 months after the baseline survey, all RCT participants - both those who received a loan and those who did not - were called back and invited to be re-interviewed. We returned to those who declined and offered them an incentive (a mobile phone SIM card).

In contrast, the community-level intervention, a more comprehensive intervention that included several community and school activities in addition to the communications campaign, was successful in reaching the target audience with handwashing promotion messages and in improving the knowledge of the treated population on appropriate handwashing behavior. Those improvements translated into higher self-reported and observed handwashing with soap at critical junctures.

Villages received block grants for maternal and child health and education that incorporated relative performance incentives. Subdistricts were randomized into incentives, an otherwise identical program without incentives, or control. Incentives initially improved preventative health indicators, particularly in underdeveloped areas, and spending efficiency increased. While school enrollments improved overall, incentives had no differential impact on education, and incentive health effects diminished over time. Reductions in neonatal mortality in non-incentivized areas did not persist with incentives. We find no scoring manipulation and no funding reallocation toward richer areas.",2007-07-02,2010-01-01,"Health, education, impacts of incentives, cost effectiveness of program","- Impact on health indicators: Over the two years of the program, the targeted maternal and child indicators, including prenatal visits, delivery by trained midwives, childhood immunizations, and growth monitoring, were an average of 0.04 standard deviations higher in incentivized areas than in non-incentivized areas. This effect was driven primarily by increases in the number of prenatal visits, which was 8.2 percent higher in incentivized areas than non-incentivized areas, and regular monthly weight checks for children under five, which were 4.5 percent higher in incentivized areas than non-incentivized areas. While these differences are modest, the impact of the incentives was more pronounced in areas with low baseline levels of service delivery: the incentives improved the targeted maternal and child health indicators as much as 0.11 – 0.14 standard deviations in the poorer, off-Java provinces.

- Impact on education indicators: There were no differences between incentivized and non-incentivized areas on the four education indicators examined (primary and junior secondary enrollment and attendance).

- Adverse impacts of incentives: Researchers found little evidence that providing incentives had adverse effects. There was no evidence of a multi-tasking problem, or that immunization records or school attendance was manipulated.

- Mechanism of impact: The results suggest two main channels through which the incentives may have had an impact. First, the incentives appear to have led to a 16 percent decrease in spending on school supplies and uniforms, and a 6.5 percent increase on health expenditures. Despite the reallocation of funds away from school supplies and uniforms, households were no less likely to receive these items and they were of no lesser value, and were actually more likely to receive education scholarships in the incentivized areas. The results suggest that the change in budgets resulted from more efficient spending. The incentives also led to an increase in the labor of midwives, who are the major providers of maternal and child health services in the area. By contrast, there was no change in labor supplied by teachers.

- Cost-effectiveness analysis: Researchers calculated the total benefits of the program as the total number of “bonus points” the program created, using the weighting scheme assigned to each of the 12 indicators to calculate a village’s performance. Researchers calculated that the Generasi program as a whole cost about US$8-US$11 to generate one additional bonus point. Translating bonus points back into outcomes suggests, for example, that the implied cost of preventing one malnourished child was US$384-US$528, and the cost of enrolling one more child in primary school was US$200-US$275. When the additional costs of the performance incentives are isolated, the cost of the incentives themselves comes out to US$0.60 per point (e.g., US$30 per additional malnourished child prevented). This suggests that while the program itself is not particularly cost-effective, providing incentives is a way to make it more cost-effective than a normal block grant program. Adding similar performance incentives to other, pre-existing block grant schemes (holding the total amount of money spent) could be a very cost-effective way to improve aid effectiveness.","The randomization was conducted at the subdistrict (kecamatan) level, so all villages within a subdistrict either received the same version (either all incentivized or all non- incentivized) or were in the control group. Since some services (e.g. health services, junior secondary schools) service multiple villages within the same subdistrict, but rarely serve people from other subdistricts, randomizing at the subdistrict level and treating all villages within the subdistrict estimates the program’s true net impact, rather than possible reallocations among villages. A total of 264 eligible subdistricts were randomized into either one of the two treatment groups or the control group. 

In the first year, both treatment groups received program funds based on the number of target beneficiaries in each village (i.e. the number of children and the expected number of pregnant women). In the second year, funds were allocated in the same way in non-incentivized villages, but in incentivized villages 20 percent of the funds were distributed based on village’s performance on the 12 indicators during the last year. The purpose of this bonus was to increase villages’ effort at achieving the targeted indicators, both by encouraging a more effective allocation of funds and by stimulating increased efforts to encourage mothers and children to obtain appropriate health care and increase educational enrollment and attendance.

The block grants averaged US$8,500 in the first year of the program and US$13,500 in the second year of the program. To decide how to spend the grant money, trained facilitators helped each village elect an 11-member village management team, as well as select local facilitators and volunteers. Consultation workshops were then held with local health and education providers to gather information and technical assistance, and coordinate the use of the funds.","",By computer,Subdistrict (kecamatan) level,"264 subdistricts with 3,120 villages","12,306 Households; 2,315 villages; 300 community health centers; 1,177 village midwives; 1,197 primary schools; 867 junior secondary schools; 2,397 village head post cadres","Total Subdistricts in initial randomization:

The SHOPS project in Jordan (locally known as the Strengthening Family Planning project) has been implementing a comprehensive community health outreach program designed to specifically address one of the most difficult programmatic challenges in family planning: changing attitudes and behaviors among women with the highest unmet need. Under the project, community health workers make home visits to married women of reproductive age across Jordan to discuss the benefits and options of modern family planning methods as well as provide referrals for family planning. Given the important role of husbands in family planning decision-making (DHS data and available qualitative evidence), the project is implementing a pilot outreach program where couples are counseled as well. 

The main objectives of this research are to (1) measure the impact of counseling women on family planning uptake, (2) measure the impact of counseling couples on family planning decisions and uptake as compared to counseling women alone, and (3) identify the mechanisms (spousal communication, bargaining power, fertility preferences, etc.) through which counseling - either alone or as a couple - affects family planning use. After a screening exercise to identify study eligible households and a baseline survey, women are randomly assigned to three groups: counseling alone, counseling with their husbands, or no counseling. Outreach visits by the community health workers and a detailed endline survey are then conducted to measure differences in family planning uptake between the three groups. 

The study is among the first to measure the effect of husband's involvement on family planning use in an Arab country, where important contextual factors related to fertility decision making within a household or a couple may lead to different results than in other settings.

","","1. Site selection (urban only)
The study was limited to urban areas only that are not currently an area targeted for family planning outreach activities by other agencies or previous home outreach locations by General Union of Voluntary Services and Circassian Charity Association (the project's current home implementing partners).  This study area has not received outreach work by the predecessor project in the past three years.

2. Research firm recruitment and training 
Interviewers were recruited through a research firm. Interviewers were fluent in Arabic and English and have experience conducting surveys. The interviewers participated in a week-long training which covered survey interviewing techniques, project goals, research ethics and confidentiality, and practice interviews. 

3. Household screening, selection of eligible women
Within the selected study site(s), a screener visit was conducted by a research firm to determine which households contain eligible women. Women are eligible if they met the following criteria:
- Currently married
- Ages 15-49
- Not currently pregnant
- Not currently using modern family planning
- Resides with her husband
- Family does not intend on changing residence in the next year

During the screener visit basic information was collected that enabled us to determine eligibility, and locate the household again (i.e. names, phone numbers of key family members, house address). Screeners first asked any adult member of the household whether any married women between the ages of 15 and 49 currently lived in the household with their husbands. If there was more than one woman in the household who met those basic criteria, only one woman was be randomly chosen to be further screened for participation in the study. Note that all potentially eligible women in the household had an equal chance of being selected for further screening, even if they were not at home during the first visit.

For the second part of the screening, screeners met in a private location with the randomly selected woman who met the basic eligibility criteria to ask more sensitive screening questions about pregnancy intentions and use of family planning. Screeners also asked about whether the woman had ever used a modern family planning method (used for stratification). If the woman was eligible to participate according to all of the eligibility criteria, the screener sought her consent and proceeded with the baseline survey if the respondent was available. Otherwise, screeners would set up appointments for the baseline survey with the respondent who agreed to participate. 

Each eligible woman was assigned an identification (ID) number, regardless of whether she consented to participate in the study. The research firm developed and assigned a unique ID number for each survey respondent. 

4. Baseline survey
The baseline survey includes questions on demographic and socio-economic characteristics, communication with family members, fertility history and preferences, as well as family planning experiences. The husband, other family members, friends, or other people were not present during the survey. The only exception was children ages 5 and under.  Only those who agreed to be surveyed and counseled completed a baseline survey.

5. Randomization to treatment arms (T1, T2, C)
Based on the data entered from the screening form, the research team randomized participant households into one of three counseling treatment arms:
- Treatment #1 (T1): Women counseled alone
- Treatment #2 (T2): Women counseled with their husbands
- Control (C): No counseling for women or their husbands
Randomization was stratified on previous use of modern methods and other explanatory variables to insure balanced groups. This variable was captured in the screening process.

Randomization was conducted in phases to avoid a long time window between the survey and counseling intervention and, thereby, reduce the likelihood of attrition. The research team had a 2 week window between the survey and counseling. This required close monitoring of the data collection and a data entry process that enabled quick entry of the screening and cover sheet data.

6. Counseling outreach visits
Only those who fully completed the baseline survey participated in the counseling.

Lists of names and contact information collected during the screener visits were given to the implementing partner to use for their health workers to conduct their visits. The CHWs were also handed data cards to record information on women or couples during the counseling visits.  For households selected to participate in couple counseling, the CHW counseled the couple for at least the first household visit. Thereafter, the CHW may have counseled the woman alone if the husband was not available. 
Vouchers were given to all women who were interviewed. 

During follow-up outreach visits for each group (women alone or women and husbands), information about voucher redemption and use of FP services at private or public clinics/doctors were collected.  

7. Follow-up survey
After completion of the outreach counseling cycle, endline surveys will be collected among all participant women and their husbands, separately.","",Randomization done in office by a computer using Stata,Household,14 clusters (stratification by 7 sub areas and by ever use of family planning method),"Planned 1,600 households, but actual study has fewer observations","Planned 532 households control, 532 households treatment 1 (wife only counseling), 532 households treatment 2 (husband and wife counseling) ",""

","The evaluation will target low-performing third-grade students from 48 schools in metropolitan Lima that participated in either treatment or control groups in the 2012 pilot project.  Within each school, half of the low-performing students will be assigned to the remedial education treatment and half to control conditions.  The evaluation design will therefore stratify at the school level.  

According to total enrollment levels collected from school principals at baseline in 2012, we anticipate, on average, 48 third-grade students per school distributed in two third-grade sections per school.   Logistical reasons explain why we aim to target the same schools as the 2012 pilot. In the treatment schools, UCH already has contacts with the administration, which should facilitate the implementation of the program.  In addition, data collection by IPA in the control schools went according to plan and there was little attrition and non-response.

IPA Peru will administer a baseline evaluation test to students in April 2014. This test will be a similar though simplified version of the science test that was used in the 2012 Science Education pilot. This test was developed to assess third-grade science proficiency according to the Peruvian National Curriculum, which includes as subdomains: “Physical World” (“Mundo Físico y conservación del ambiente”), “Human body and health” (“Cuerpo humano y conservación de la salud”) and “Animals and environment conservation” (“Animales y ambiente”). It is a timed self-administered written test that students will be given to complete on their own, without a surveyor. A surveyor will be present at the school to supervise the appropriate and timely administration of the test. Each section (corresponding to one of the three areas of the curriculum) is separately timed.

During the implementation of the program, IPA Peru will develop an end-line test of the same abilities measured for the baseline. The test will be given at the end of the school year to all the third grade students in participating schools to see if those who were placed in the treatment group were able to close the gap with the other students from their class. Both baseline and end-line will be norm-referenced, standardizing all student test scores in standard deviations above or below the control group mean. 

In addition, teachers will be surveyed to collect demographic data and to gather their views on different aspects of teaching Science and Environment. Collecting this information at baseline and end-line will permit observing any changes in teacher’s perceptions of teaching science material. School directors of the sample schools will also be surveyed about their experience and characteristics of their schools, including the number of teachers, school enrollment, infrastructure, equipment and learning materials and school climate.  Lastly, students will be sent home with questionnaires for parents with questions about the support and assistance that the child receives for homework, the household's socioeconomic status and other characteristics such as household size and education of parents. Both the data collected at baseline from the school directors and parents will serve to ensure balance between treatment and control groups.  Additionally, the data will also be used to perform heterogeneity analysis to identify variation in effects between subgroups, such as students in homes with a working television, or students in schools with operational sanitation facilities

Among these 1100 students, half will be randomly assigned to treatment and the other half will be assigned to control conditions. The attrition rate during the 2012 Science Education pilot was 13 percent, and a more conservative 15 percent is used for these power size calculations. A correlation of 0.576 between baseline and end line was calculated, based on the 2012 sample of students. Assuming a five percent level of significance and 80 percent statistical power, the expected minimum detectable treatment effect is (MDE) 0.16 standard deviations. As the randomization will be stratified by school, this reduces the MDE holding all other parameters constant, making this MDE likely a conservative estimate. We find it is reasonable to conduct an empirical study in which the MDE is 0.16 given the results of previous remedial and tracking programs, ranging from .14 to .28 standard deviations."

This study takes place in Mongolia where many recent migrants to urban areas lack property rights. Researchers are evaluating the impact of a program that provides direct assistance to households seeking to privatize and register land plots. They will measure the program’s impact on the migrants’ access to credit, investment in land and housing, property values, labor market outcomes, and household income.

 
Policy Issue: 
Having a well-defined system of land and property rights is thought to be extremely important for increasing investment, as ownership of land may incentivize investment by ensuring that tenants receive the long-term returns from improving their land. Property rights may also be an important component in access to credit, since land can be used as a collateral asset and increase the likelihood of a borrower receiving a loan. Large land-titling policies have been undertaken in several developing countries, particularly in South America and Southeast Asia in order to increase land investments and income security. 

Context of the Evaluation: 
More and more poor rural Mongolians are abandoning traditional nomadic herding practices and migrating to the cities in search of better lives. The bulk of these migrants are moving to Mongolia’s three biggest cities – Ulaanbaatar, Erdenet and Darkhan – where they either settle in suburban “ger areas” or peri-urban rangeland areas, often creating informal settlements. Mongolian laws give ger area residents the right to obtain ownership to the land upon which they live. However, the complexity and expense of this process make it difficult to become an owner and thus use the land as a marketable asset.

The Urban Property Rights Project aims to improve the formal system for recognizing and transferring land rights to ger area residents. This effort includes legal and regulatory reform, upgrading the technology necessary for accurate land parcel mapping, and providing direct assistance to households to privatize and register their land plots. The project is being carried out in Ulaanbaatar and eight other regional centers.

The researchers intend to track microenterprises over a 16-week period, with random assignment to alternative survey methods. The trial will run in Soweto, a low-income neighbourhood in South Africa, where the team is working with a partner NGO to prepare a randomised evaluation of an entrepreneurship training program. This presents an ideal opportunity to explore innovative data collection methods for microenterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The researchers will conduct a listing exercise in Soweto in order to build a representative sample of 900 enterprises, which will then be divided between three data collection methods, using stratified random assignment:
 - conventional face-to-face interviews at four-weekly intervals
 - conventional face-to-face interviews at weekly intervals; and
 - mobile-phone based interviews at weekly intervals.
This will allow the team to investigate (i) the relative accuracy of face-to-face and mobile phone-based interviews, and (ii) the degree of volatility in microenterprise outcomes omitted from low-frequency (monthly) interviews.

If the results from this study suggest that we can accurately collect high-frequency data on microenterprise profits and sales using mobile phones, researchers will have a powerful and cheap new method for measuring volatility and dynamics in microenterprise performance. This is directly relevant for a very wide range of policy questions concerning microenterprises. For example, it is often argued that one key advantage of microfinance is that it helps to smooth shocks. It remains unclear whether microfinance does this by implicitly insuring microenterprises against unanticipated shocks, or by helping microenterprises to deal more effectively with ‘lumpy’ costs (such as end-of-month rent payments). This is a critical distinction for understanding how microfinance products can be improved, but is very difficult to identify without high-frequency data. If mobile phones can be used to reliably measure microenterprise performance, researchers will be able to characterise this volatility much more precisely, and better understand how volatility shifts over time.",2014-03-10,2014-07-04,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.,See attached pre-analysis plan.

The evaluation uses a stratified random assignment design, whereby districts within each of Rwanda’s five provinces were paired based on district population and economic characteristics and then randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. We designed a household survey to collect data for evaluating SCP impacts, and administered this survey at baseline before the program (in early 2011) and one year after the start of the program (2012). We drew nationally representative samples of approximately 10,000 households in each data collection round.

Respondents were also asked about their overall satisfaction with government services related to water infrastructure, local road conditions, waste collection, public schools, and health clinics.","We estimated the impacts of the Strengthening Civic Participation program for six outcome indices: awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, knowledge about local government affairs, access to district government information, citizen influence on government, and satisfaction with local services. We constructed these outcome indices by grouping together survey questions related to the same underlying outcome using factor analysis. We did this for several reasons. First, estimating the impacts by comparing the treatment and the control groups on several survey questions is likely to result in one or more statistically significant impacts by chance when there is actually no impact. In other words, we are more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, when considering a series of hypothesis tests—a problem commonly known as the multiple comparison problem (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Second, since factor analysis assumes that the observed variables are influenced by a few underlying variables or factors that are unobserved, constructing those underlying latent variables (the unobserved factors) can provide useful information about processes or behavior of the population of interest. Third, grouping survey questions into a few outcome indices helps in examining impacts in a tractable manner.

For each of the six outcome domains, we conducted factor analysis using the survey questions or observed variables that are most relevant for that domain in three steps: 

(1) We used the principal-component factor method to obtain the factor solutions. For each outcome domain, we found that only one underlying factor explained the variation in the responses to the included survey questions. 

(2) We then used orthogonal rotation to rotate the factor loadings and estimated factor scores using the regression method, which estimates a factor as a weighted sum of the included observed variables. 

(3) Finally, we converted each of the six estimated factors to binary variables to interpret the impact estimates better. In particular, if a survey respondent’s factor score was above the mean score for the full survey sample in that year, the binary variable was coded as 1, otherwise it was coded as 0.  Thus, the impact estimates compare the percentage of citizens with an above-average factor score in the treatment districts with the percentage in control districts. ","The activities under the Strengthening Civic Participation component of the RTP were planned to be implemented in two separate, year-long phases, with 15 districts receiving activities in each phase. We took advantage of this plan by randomly dividing Rwanda’s 30 districts to either phase I or phase II. To do so, districts within each province were first matched in pairs or groups of three to ensure the best possible match between the two district groups.  The districts were matched on the following five district characteristics:
 
•	Population change between 2002 and 2006
•	Population density
•	Common Development Fund (CDF) appropriation amounts for FY 2008 (as a proxy for poverty levels)
•	Share of district spending obtained through local revenues in FY 2008
•	District expenditure per capita on good governance and social affairs 

These matched district pairs or triplets were then used as randomization blocks. Specifically, after these blocks were created a public lottery was conducted in the presence of district officials to randomly assign districts within each block to the treatment group (districts that would receive program activities in phase I in 2011), or the control group (districts that were to receive program activities in phase II in 2012). The 15 control districts never received any program activities because the RTP was not extended beyond 2011.

The study takes advantage of Al Amana's expansion into rural areas with no previous microcredit penetration, before the introduction of the product and for the duration of the study. We designed a sampling strategy that allows us to estimate the impact on borrowers, and also to capture impacts representative at the village level. Within the catchment areas of newly-opened branches, 81 pairs of matched villages were included in the study. The treatment villages, randomly selected within each pair, received access to Al Amana loans immediately, while villages in the control group were only offered microcredit two years later. Following Al Amana's timeline of branch openings between 2006 and 2007, a baseline survey grouped in four waves was administered to collect data on socio-economic characteristics, household production, members’ outside work, consumption, credit and women’s role in the household. A follow-up survey conducted two years later found that, among the thirteen percent of households in treatment villages who took a loan, microcredit had large, albeit heterogeneous, impacts on assets and profits from self-employment activities, but that any potential gains in consumption were offset by a reduction in income from casual labor.

Female empowerment: we used several proxies, including (i) the number of income-generating activities managed by a female household member; (ii) qualitative indicators to describe female empowerment such as the capacity of women to make decisions, and their mobility inside and outside the village.


","The design of our study tracked the expansion of Al Amana into rural areas between 2006 and 2007. Before each branch was opened, data was collected from at least six villages located on the periphery of the intervention areas - villages that could either have been included or excluded in the branch's catchment area. Selected villages were then matched in pairs based on observable characteristics (number of households, accessibility to the center of the community, existing infrastructure, type of activities carried out by the households, type of agricultural activities). In each pair, one village was randomly assigned to treatment and the other to control. 

Our sampling strategy followed a novel approach to maximize the evaluation's power to detect both direct and population-level effects of microcredit access. Specifically, we selected two samples of households: one containing those with the highest probability to become clients of the microfinance institution and one containing a random selection of households from the rest of the population. Using the first sample increases the probability to detect an effect on those who are the most likely to borrow, if there is one. Using both samples together, with appropriate weights, allows us to measure the effect on the whole population of offering access to microcredit.

Even though performance-based financing models have been implemented in developed and developing countries in various settings and forms, the scientific evidence on its impact on health worker effort and consequent health outcomes remains thin. From 2009 to 2013, a research project was conducted in the Haut-Katanga district of DRC to study the effect of the PBF approach compared to a fixed payment approach. The 96 health areas present in the Haut-Katanga district were randomly assigned to performance-based or fixed payments, while ensuring that the same amount of governmental resources was allocated to each group to neutralize the ressource effect. The two mechanisms have been in place from June 2010 to September 2012.

We give evidence that pay-for-performance led to more effort from health workers with respect to rewarded services. Equally important, health workers did not substitute effort put in non-rewarded activities. However, the increase in overall staff motivation happened at the expense of its intrinsic component. Finally, the increased effort put in by the health workers proved unsuccessful at attracting more patients, suggesting that health workers lacked means or inventiveness to meet their objective. There are key policy implications of our findings for governments considering PBF as a way to allocate public ressources to the health sector. First, pay-for-performance increases health worker overall motivation without deterring service quality or non-rewarded services, meaning that health workers are strategic but not cynical; However, two types of precaution should be considered. First, contingent rewards reduce the intrinsic component of health worker motivation so incentives should be used as a permanent instrument otherwise it would backfire. Second, our results suggest that contingent rewards are not appropriate when the task is difficult and requires sophisticated strategies, because agents focus on the reward and do not develop novel ideas to reach complicated goals.

Clients receiving follow-up or continuation care (i.e. a client returning for a routine hormonal injectable or additional supply of oral contraceptive packets) will not be eligible for enrollment. Additionally, clients who wish to obtain a method but were not able to based on contraindications or medical eligibility criteria reasons will not be eligible if they are not able to obtain the method at the time of the Jacaranda consultation. Furthermore, although this has not been previously observed at Jacaranda facilities, clients obtaining methods with the intent to delay use (for example, pregnant women aiming to obtain a method for use after delivery) will not be eligible. Eligibility will not be limited to postpartum women (defined as women who have delivered in the past 1 year), with nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous women eligible for participation if other eligibility criteria are met.","Randomization will be conducted using reproducible code (using STATA software). Randomization is not stratified, but is rather simple random randomization using patient ID numbers assigned by the partner organization sequentially by time of first visit to the facility.",The unit of randomization is the individual. ,0 clusters. All clients will be recruited at maternity hospitals operated by the local partner organization.,The relevant sample for our SMS intervention will be 600 women.,We aim to enroll equal groups of 300 women in the control and intervention arms.,"We use two primary outcomes of interest in order to calculate power. Our first outcome is the probability of discontinuation by 6 months, defined as the percentage of women who are not using the original method (method adopted at enrollment) for a continuous period of 6 months. Using Jacaranda’s administrative data, we assume that the method mix at original uptake will reflect Jacaranda family planning clients since October 2013. We thus assume that 10% of our sample will obtain pills (combined or progestin-only), 1.4% male condoms, 28.8% injectables, 41.8% implants, and 18% IUCDs. Assuming an exponential decay in contraceptive continuation and using discontinuation probabilities from the Demographic and Health Surveys, we assume an average probability of discontinuation by 6 months in a sample using this method mix to be 11.9% (KDHS 2008/2009; Ali, Cleland, and Shah 2012; FHI360). We would then have 80% power to detect a decrease in discontinuation at 6 months of 6 percentage points. This change would represent a decrease in the overall probability of discontinuation at 6 months to 5.5%, which would represent a significant reduction in discontinuation. We believe this reduction is plausible, given 50-80% of discontinuation is due to the same types of method-related problems (such as dissatisfaction, inconvenience, side effects or health concerns) that our intervention aims to address (Ali, Cleland, and Shah 2012). 

Our second outcome is receipt of follow-up care related to contraceptive use by 6 months. Currently, 19% of Jacaranda’s family planning clients return for a second family planning consultation. With 600 women in our study, assuming equal groups of 300 women, we will have 80% power to detect an increase in the probability of returning for care with 6 months of use of 9% points. This change would represent a significant improvement in contraceptive follow-up care, and is believed to be feasible given similar effects sizes on appointment follow-up caused by mHealth reminder interventions in Kenya (Odeny et al. 2012)."

Extensive data has already been collected on a range of business outcomes and has found significant effects of pairing ILO Start Your Business (SYB) trainings with microfinance on business outcomes for men. It is though unclear what the effect of these programs has been on general individual and household welfare. The next data collections will conduct two household follow-up surveys of the participants of the program to understand the long-term effect of cash grants and finance for both business and household welfare outcomes.",2012-08-01,2012-11-01,"The main questions of interest for the next rounds of data collection include a range of indicators on the following topics:

1.	Income
The existing data collection has focused on outcomes for the main business. Individuals and households in Africa though often have multiple sources of income. It is not clear from the current data if the money from the grants and loans was used for productive investment in other enterprises, or has replaced other income. A detailed exploration of the other businesses run by the individual and others within the family will be conducted. 

2.	Intra-household bargaining and money allocation 
The issue of money allocation within the household is important, especially for married women. The initial results of the SYB evaluation show a negative effect for married women with family living nearby. It is not yet clear what happened to the money women received. It is common for women in Africa to have little or no control over money they earn or receive and are expected to give money to their husbands or extended family for both productive and non-productive investment. This new survey will explore women’s bargaining power over money within the household to determine what might have led to these negative results and determine where the money went. 

3.	Investment in household welfare
While the initial results for men with training and loans has been to increase business profits, it is not clear what the men did with the money. There are currently no consumption or savings impacts from the program. It is possible that men simply use the extra money for short-term individual consumption, which would not have significant welfare implications. It is also possible that there is a hidden welfare effect on business or household assets and investment. The household survey will thus explore the household assets and spending further to determine if there is a positive welfare effect from the programs. 

4.	Unintended consequences
The initial results have raised a number of questions about the unintended consequences of the programs, especially for family employment and child schooling. The household survey will further explore this issue to better understand whether the business owners pulled children out of school to work in the business, and if so, for how long. 
","","From August to October 2012, 1,550 microenterprise owners in Uganda were offered randomly either a loan, grant, businesses skills training, a combination of these programs, or no program (the control group). ","Individuals have been randomly selected and split into five different groups. 406 were assigned to the loans intervention, 401 to the loans and training, 167 to grants, 219 to grants and training, and 357 to the control group. The sample sizes were based on power calculations after taking into account implementation budget limitations.

A local microfinance organization, PRIDE Microfinance, provided the loans. Unknown to the participants, the loans were guaranteed by the ILO as the sample came from all businesses that expressed interest in a loan. These businesses may not have fit the lending requirements of PRIDE, and so a guarantee was decided upon to mitigate risk. PRIDE normally provides loans with an interest rate of 26% and requires 100% collateral. Lenders reduced the interest rate to 20% and described the program as a special promotion to individuals. For those who were not able to provide 100% collateral, PRIDE agreed to accept 50% collateral instead. This special promotion was designed to encourage participation in the loan program and to reflect what a subsidized loan program might be like if conducted in the future. Individuals were then required to repay the loan in monthly installments, starting in the first month. 

The ILO delivered the cash grants through PRIDE bank accounts. The ILO then contacted individuals to attend information meetings explaining how the cash grant program would work. They were then asked to open a free savings account, where the money would be deposited. 

The ILO conducted the trainings using the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) training modules. This training program reached 4.5 million people in 100 countries from 2003 to 2010. Researchers have evaluated the trainings experimentally twice before. First, Mano et al 2012 looked at the effect of giving training to 53 business owners. In keeping with other training results, they found survival rates increased, as did the incidence of good business practices such as keeping budgets, with no consistent effects on business profit. de Mel et al (2008) also use the SIYB training on female business training and cash grants in Sri Lanka. They found no effect on profits for those already in business for training, but some initial effect for the grants that disappears after the second year. There is also increased entry for those without business and some income growth. The trainings have thus been evaluated previously and have presented mixed results. It was decided not to pursue a pure training treatment arm, but instead use trainings as a potential augmenting effect on the use of cash grants and loans to test if training can increase the effects of decreasing capital constraints through better business management practices or attitudes.

Pay by Design Teacher Performance Pay Experiment in Rural China ,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/411,"July 11, 2014",2014-06-23 18:46:09 -0400,AEARCTR-0000411,"Prashant Loyalka, prashantloyalka@gmail.com",in_development,2013-09-27,2014-12-31,"[""education"", """"]","","In developing countries, educational systems are often designed to serve the elite. This can be true not only at the institutional level, but also within classrooms. Singular focus on competitive entrance examinations leads teachers—even in early grades—to focus on the best students at the expense of those perceived as having less potential. Performance pay schemes, as they are commonly designed, can exacerbate inequality in outcomes by strengthening incentives further for teachers to focus on students with the most potential. In this paper, we present the results from a randomized evaluation designed to test the impact of teacher performance pay (which is increasingly used to address weak incentives facing educators in developing countries) on not only the level, but also the distribution of gains in student achievement. Teachers across 216 schools were randomly assigned to one of three incentive groups or a control group. In the first incentive group (“levels”), teachers were rewarded based on levels of student achievement measured by student scores on year-end standardized exams. In the second group (“gains”), teachers were rewarded based on average gains in student achievement over the course of one school year. In the third incentive group (“pay-for-percentile”), teachers were offered an incentive scheme designed explicitly to allocate teacher effort equally across all students in the class, regardless of baseline achievement (based on the pay-for-percentile scheme proposed by Berlevy and Neal (AER, 2012)).

Another concern for policymakers in the design of teacher performance pay programs is whether the size of the incentive payout—or strength of the incentive—matters in a performance pay program. On the one hand, incentivizing teachers with potentially larger payouts may be more effective than incentivizing teachers with smaller payouts. On the other hand, incentivizing teachers with smaller payouts may be just as effective (and therefore more cost-effective). This would be the case, for example, if there were diminishing marginal returns to providing teachers with performance pay. By using a (4X2) crosscutting experimental design, our randomized experiment also tests whether the size of the payout (large payout versus small payout versus control group) impacts gains in student achievement.

We refer to these agents as the “selected agents.” These ALATS are then randomly assigned into three groups according to how and when the agents will receive their phones. 
 							
The phones will be issued in three waves. In the first wave, the first group, consisting of half of the ALATs, will not receive phones and will serve as the control group.

","In an effort to investigate factors behind the low uptake of VMMC in South Africa, this pilot study will employ a randomised control field experiment design in Soweto, Gauteng. The experiment involves the hand-delivery of postcards containing social marketing messages and/or vouchers to compensate participants for transport associated with travelling to the VMMC site, as well as some of the time they spend on the study. By randomising which households receive a particular message, voucher, or combination thereof and comparing uptake across these groups, we will be able to measure the relative effectiveness of each message and the transport voucher in increasing the uptake of VMMC.
We will evaluate the impact on uptake of VMMC of three different postcard-based VMMC recruitment mechanisms relative to a basic VMMC postcard (which will contain basic information about the participating VMMC facilities). The three main VMMC recruitment mechanisms are:
(i)	A transport voucher for R100 conditional upon completing a VMMC consultation at one of the listed participating VMMC facilities, 
(ii)	Information that ‘2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men’, and
(iii)	The statement, “Are you tough enough?” 

All postcards, including the basic VMMC postcard, will include a voucher for light refreshments, conditional on completing a VMMC consultation. This provides an incentive for participants to bring in their postcard if they choose to visit a participating VMMC clinic, which will allow us to measure the effect of each type of postcard on take-up of the VMMC consultation relative to the basic VMMC postcard. All postcards will include a list of participating VMMC facilities (CHAPS has VMMC clinics in 75% of health facilities in the area, thus the list should provide a facility that is accessible to all postcard recipients). 
An overlapping design will be implemented, such that there will be six unique postcards:

Postcard 1: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 2: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 3: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 4: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 5: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 6: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)

One thousand postcards per treatment arm, and thus 6000 postcards in total (across all 6 arms) will be hand-distributed by CHAPS outreach workers to households in Soweto, Gauteng, with random assignment of each type of postcard to households based on a random-walk sampling algorithm. 

In addition to the aforementioned details, all postcards will contain a phone number and instructions for sending a SMS to the specified number should recipients want to receive more information from an advice nurse, who will make a follow-up call within 2 days of receiving the SMS (the postcard will inform recipients that they will receive a follow-up call from an advice nurse within 2 days of sending their message). The phone number will be different for each group, in order to track which postcards generate the most initial interest. 
Project staff in each listed facility will record each clinic visit made by an individual with a postcard, as well as whether they received the postcard from a CHAPS outreach worker or a family member or friend. It is believed that the light refreshments provides a small incentive for bringing the card into the facility, which will encourage postcard recipients to provide us with evidence (that is, the actual postcard) indicating which treatment they received. This will allow us to measure which of the postcards most effectively encourages uptake of the VMMC consultation and uptake of the VMMC procedure. Project staff will also record the number of postcard recipients that complete a VMMC consultation, and the number of postcard recipients that complete the VMMC procedure.

Further, in an effort to assess which individuals are most at risk for HIV infection, a short survey will be conducted both with males that SMS the listed phone numbers for information, and males that visit the VMMC facilities, either for a consultation or to have the procedure done, or both. The cost-effectiveness of this intervention depends critically upon the relative risk profile of individuals who are encouraged to get circumcised. That is, if males most at risk of HIV infection choose to get circumcised, the effectiveness of this intervention is dramatically larger than if those who are least at risk choose to get circumcised. The survey will collect information about basic demographic characteristics, self-reported risky sexual behaviour, and other factors related to risk of HIV infection. The survey will be administered in two ways: (1) for SMS users, the survey will be conducted telephonically by the advice nurse, a few weeks after they have sent a SMS, in order to provide time to seek VMMC services.

The survey will include questions about whether the individual sent a SMS to the VMMC hotline on the postcard and whether they completed the phone survey in order to avoid duplication. Project staff will also request permission to record the results of the STI and HIV tests (standard in VMMC consultations) for these men, in addition to the survey.","In an effort to investigate factors behind the low uptake of VMMC in South Africa, this pilot study will employ a randomised control field experiment design in Soweto, Gauteng. The experiment involves the hand-delivery of postcards containing social marketing messages and/or vouchers to compensate participants for transport associated with travelling to the VMMC site, as well as some of the time they spend on the study. By randomising which households receive a particular message, voucher, or combination thereof and comparing uptake across these groups, we will be able to measure the relative effectiveness of each message and the transport voucher in increasing the uptake of VMMC.
We will evaluate the impact on uptake of VMMC of three different postcard-based VMMC recruitment mechanisms relative to a basic VMMC postcard (which will contain basic information about the participating VMMC facilities). The three main VMMC recruitment mechanisms are:
(i)	A transport voucher for R100 conditional upon completing a VMMC consultation at one of the listed participating VMMC facilities, 
(ii)	Information that ‘2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men’, and
(iii)	The statement, “Are you tough enough?” 

All postcards, including the basic VMMC postcard, will include a voucher for light refreshments, conditional on completing a VMMC consultation. This provides an incentive for participants to bring in their postcard if they choose to visit a participating VMMC clinic, which will allow us to measure the effect of each type of postcard on take-up of the VMMC consultation relative to the basic VMMC postcard. All postcards will include a list of participating VMMC facilities (CHAPS has VMMC clinics in 75% of health facilities in the area, thus the list should provide a facility that is accessible to all postcard recipients). 
An overlapping design will be implemented, such that there will be six unique postcards:

Postcard 1: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 2: Basic information about clinics and HIV prevention benefits of VMMC + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 3: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 4: Information that 2 out of 3 partners of uncircumcised men prefer circumcised men + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 5: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)
Postcard 6: A challenge, “Are you tough enough?” + Basic information + R100 transport voucher (conditional on completing VMMC consultation) + Refreshments (conditional on completing VMMC consultation)

One thousand postcards per treatment arm, and thus 6000 postcards in total (across all 6 arms) will be hand-distributed by CHAPS outreach workers to households in Soweto, Gauteng, with random assignment of each type of postcard to households based on a random-walk sampling algorithm. 

In addition to the aforementioned details, all postcards will contain a phone number and instructions for sending a SMS to the specified number should recipients want to receive more information from an advice nurse, who will make a follow-up call within 2 days of receiving the SMS (the postcard will inform recipients that they will receive a follow-up call from an advice nurse within 2 days of sending their message). The phone number will be different for each group, in order to track which postcards generate the most initial interest. 
Project staff in each listed facility will record each clinic visit made by an individual with a postcard, as well as whether they received the postcard from a CHAPS outreach worker or a family member or friend. It is believed that the light refreshments provides a small incentive for bringing the card into the facility, which will encourage postcard recipients to provide us with evidence (that is, the actual postcard) indicating which treatment they received. This will allow us to measure which of the postcards most effectively encourages uptake of the VMMC consultation and uptake of the VMMC procedure. Project staff will also record the number of postcard recipients that complete a VMMC consultation, and the number of postcard recipients that complete the VMMC procedure.

Further, in an effort to assess which individuals are most at risk for HIV infection, a short survey will be conducted both with males that SMS the listed phone numbers for information, and males that visit the VMMC facilities, either for a consultation or to have the procedure done, or both. The cost-effectiveness of this intervention depends critically upon the relative risk profile of individuals who are encouraged to get circumcised. That is, if males most at risk of HIV infection choose to get circumcised, the effectiveness of this intervention is dramatically larger than if those who are least at risk choose to get circumcised. The survey will collect information about basic demographic characteristics, self-reported risky sexual behaviour, and other factors related to risk of HIV infection. The survey will be administered in two ways: (1) for SMS users, the survey will be conducted telephonically by the advice nurse, a few weeks after they have sent a SMS, in order to provide time to seek VMMC services. These individuals will be contacted using the phone numbers from their SMSes and asked for consent to administer the survey, after which the survey will be administered telephonically or (2) for men that attend the VMMC facility, project staff will obtain consent from the men to administer the survey and will complete it using an interview technique. The survey will include questions about whether the individual sent a SMS to the VMMC hotline on the postcard and whether they completed the phone survey in order to avoid duplication. Project staff will also request permission to record the results of the STI and HIV tests (standard in VMMC consultations) for these men, in addition to the survey.","Randomization of the order of each set of six postcards done in office by a computer.

Our battery of outcome measures comprises both hard (objective, realised behavioural) and softer (self-reported or more subjective) outcomes. 
The majority of our hard outcome measures are educational (i.e. attainment, attendance, behaviour) and will be sourced from the National Pupil Database (NPD). The National Pupil Database (NPD) is a pupil level database which matches pupil characteristic data, such as gender, ethnicity and eligibility for free school meals, and school characteristics data to pupil level attainment.
Since the number of participants per school will be relatively small (meaning that using school level identifiers would be subject to considerable noise), we will track individual outcome measures using the unique pupil numbers (UPNs) of individual participants. All pupils have a UPN that can be linked to their performance through the NPD. UPNs stay with participants if they leave the school, and so we will be able to track them even if this happens, reducing dramatically the risk of attrition . Schools will provide the researchers with students’ UPN through their School Information Management System (SIMS) at the beginning of the trial. These numbers will be used to monitor outcome measures and attrition at the individual level, while maintaining the anonymity of the participants.
The NPD will also aid us in our data analysis as it will provide a rich set of measures that capture individual and school level characteristics, which will be useful when performing balance checks or sub-group analysis, as well as allowing us to control for time invariant school level effects  (such as teacher quality or school culture). .
Our soft outcome measures will be captured by the survey based Quality Outcomes Framework commissioned by the independent Campaign for Youth Social Action (renamed Step Up To Serve following the November 2013 launch). This framework (please see Table X  for an outline) is comprised of a set of metrics designed to assess perceived employability by capturing measures for a number of headline skills such as self-control , grit  and resilience . We will be assessing some of these outcomes by administering a pre and post intervention survey to all participants in the control and treatment groups. A detailed description of the criteria used to select the outcomes that are included in the surveys can be found in APPENDIX […]
We will also be including in the survey 4 questions for well-being developed by ONS as another soft outcome of the programme. This is an important outcome in itself and  provides at least one outcome measure that is consistent with outcomes measured across other youth programmes.

In this trial design the treatment of some groups is lagged to create a control condition, with the first group  allocated to receive the intervention acting as the treatment group and all the groups allocated to receive the intervention later acting as the control. This design may be thought of as the simplest formulation of a stepped-wedge design . 
We have chosen this design as a way to incentivise schools in the control condition to participate in the evaluation, as they still receive the intervention only at a later date. In addition, a two year pipeline design with random assignment between year 1 and year 2 maximises the statistical power available for the trial, as well as providing an incentive for groups assigned to receive the intervention in year 2 of the trial to adhere to the trial during the first year. To support the need to recruit additional schools, ENV will pay a financial grant (to be paid at the end of the trials so as not to interfere with the evaluation) to all schools that are allocated to year 2.
The participants in the trial will be recruited from secondary schools across. The programme will be implemented in 10 schools in year 1 (treatment group) and in 10 schools in year 2 (control group).

A trial for increasing tax declarations in Guatemala,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/422,"July 11, 2014",2014-06-30 12:06:50 -0400,AEARCTR-0000422,"Michael  Sanders, michael.sanders@behaviouralinsights.co.uk",on_going,2014-06-02,2015-01-01,"[""finance"", ""governance"", """"]","","This trial involves reminder letters for Guatemalan taxpayers that were due to declare their annual income tax for the 2013 tax year, but failed to do so on time. The primary objective of the trial is to increase tax compliance by increasing the number of taxpayers who declare their yearly income tax. The trial is important as Guatemala has the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America.
Many of the tools available to the governments of developed nations to induce citizens to pay their taxes are not available in Guatemala, and there is a strong need to increase tax revenue in a way that does not itself cost a great deal of money. This makes these interventions, which use behavioural science and are of low or zero cost to implement relative to treatment as usual, potentially very valuable as tools for the tax authority.
The trial involves 43,389 taxpayers, who will be randomly allocated to either receive one of five reminder letters, or be part of a control group. The trial aims to test the differential impact of the original SAT letter, and a simplified letter. We also test for the impact of a social norms message, a message that makes the decision to cheat more salient, and a letter designed to invoke national pride. In addition to declaration the trial will test the impact of the different letters on overall response rates, payment, and payment amount.
",2014-06-02,2014-06-07,"We have four outcome measures of interest, all of which will be measured at three intervals; 3, 7, and 11 weeks after the trial commences:
1)	Declaration (binary); defined as the taxpayer completing online declaration. Taxpayers declare their income for the year to the tax authorities through the Declaraguate website (http://declaraguate.sat.gob.gt/)
2)	Response (binary); defined as declaration (as above) or a call by the taxpayer to the call centre where the individual gives the alert number provided on the letter.
3)	Payment (binary); defined as the taxpayer completing payment for the full amount, or setting up a payment plan.
4)	Payment amount (continuous); the total amount paid by the taxpayer at the time of data collection.
","","The trial is an individually randomised trial which involves different variations of letters being sent from the Guatemalan tax authority (SAT) to taxpayers that were due to declare their annual income tax for the year 2013 but failed to do so. The trial involves taxpayers that have self-selected onto the tax regime ‘Regime Over Profits from Lucrative Activities’. For the 2013 tax year this involves a tax rate of 31% (28% in 2014) on taxable income (profit), chosen by taxpayers in the sample instead of the simplified regime of a 6% direct tax on gross income. Consequently the trial is likely to involve the sub-sample of taxpayers with the highest revenues. The tax was due to be declared, and paid, by the end of March and end of April 2014, respectively.","The trial is an individually randomised trial which involves different variations of letters being sent from the Guatemalan tax authority (SAT) to taxpayers that were due to declare their annual income tax for the year 2013 but failed to do so.

According to SAT, this tax has a higher rate of compliance than other Guatemalan taxes. However, compliance remains relatively low, and the incentives to comply are weak for participants, due to their relative affluence and the higher rate. These two factors (affluence and tax-rate) also make the prospect of increasing compliance with this tax particularly attractive, and increase the likelihood that any effects identified in this trial will be economically significant.
The trial involved a sample of n = 43,389 taxpayers, all taxpayers that were due to declare this tax according to SAT minus those that had already declared by May 16th or had already been contacted by SAT about failing to declare this tax. 
Each individual is randomly allocated to one of six arms:
T0) Control group – no letter (n = 12397)
T1)	Original SAT letter (n=6198)
T2)	Simplification + Deterrent (n = 6199)
T3)	Simplification + Deterrent + Social Norm (n = 6198)
T4)	Simplification + Deterrent + Omission/Commission (n = 6199)
T5)	Simplification + National Pride (n = 6198)
These interventions are explained in detail in the ‘Interventions’ section. We note that more participants are allocated to the control group than to any of the treatment arms. This is because of restrictions placed on the amount of letters that could be sent out by the mail office rather than a methodological reason.
Outcome Measure
We have four outcome measures of interest, all of which will be measured at three intervals; 3, 7, and 11 weeks after the trial commences:
1)	Declaration (binary); defined as the taxpayer completing online declaration. Taxpayers declare their income for the year to the tax authorities through the Declaraguate website (http://declaraguate.sat.gob.gt/)
2)	Response (binary); defined as declaration (as above) or a call by the taxpayer to the call centre where the individual gives the alert number provided on the letter.
3)	Payment (binary); defined as the taxpayer completing payment for the full amount, or setting up a payment plan.
4)	Payment amount (continuous); the total amount paid by the taxpayer at the time of data collection.
The outcome variables are all collected regularly as administrative data by the SAT. This has the advantage of not costing additional money to collect, while simultaneously accurately capturing the dependent variable of interest. The data on declaration is collected automatically from the declaraguate website, the data on phone responses is automatically recorded at the SAT call centres, and the payment data is sent to the SAT by the relevant banks involved in processing tax payments. All of the above data is stored centrally by SAT.
Outcome data will be collected 3, 7 and 11 weeks after the trial commences on 29th May 2014. This is for three key reasons: 1) the exact timeline that the letters will be sent over will remain unclear at the start of the trial due to uncertainty  between the SAT and the mail office over the quantity of letters feasible to send out per week, 2) the letters were estimated to be delivered over an 8 week period, the three collection periods were designed to take account of the possibilities that all letters are sent out immediately, or if the process takes much longer. 
During trial implementation monitoring data will be collected on the number of letters sent out each week. If it is the case that the letters are sent at a different rate than expected then additional collection dates can be added. Our measurement will therefore adopt an efficient pragmatic design.
Sample Selection
The sample was taken from the universe of taxpayers due to pay their annual income tax for the year 2013 according to SAT (n=115,999). From this universe we took all taxpayers that had failed to declare by 16th May 2014 (n=44,952). Finally we removed the taxpayers (n=1563) that had already been contacted by SAT about failing to pay this tax, giving us our sample of n = 43,389 taxpayers.
The 1563 taxpayers already contacted, and hence removed from the sample, were chosen by the tax authority based on their calculations on those most likely to respond to letters. Assuming that the tax authority is accurate in its targeting this creates a selection issue as our sample of taxpayers are systematically harder to reach than the general population. This means that our results are likely to provide a conservative estimate of the impact of the trial letters on the universe of taxpayers that initially failed to declare.
Eligibility
There are no restrictions to eligibility within the groups defined above.

Randomisation
Randomisation was conducted at the individual level. Each participant in the sample was assigned a random number between 0 and 1, using the random function in excel. The taxpayers were then ranked according to this number and split into 6 arms; a control arm of n=12397, and 6 treatment arms of n=6198 or 6199. As mentioned above the control arm is double the size of the treatment arms due to logistical constraints rather than for a methodological reason.
Following Bruhn and McKenzie (2009) we chose to use a pure random draw rather than testing for balance and re-randomising in the event of failure of balance on observables. Following Kahan et al (2014) any significant differences in observables between treatment arms will be controlled for in the analysis.
Data Gathering
Data is routinely gathered by the tax authority. To protect participant confidentiality, the tax authority will clean this data of the unique taxpayer identification number and other fields that would allow identification of taxpayers, before transferring data securely to BIT. 
Data Storage and Transmission
Data handling and management will be governed by BIT’s data management protocol (available on request). Data will be anonymised and stored on secure hard drives accessible only to BIT and World Bank staff working on the project. Data will not be transmitted to third parties, except where this is appropriate under the conditions of appropriate data sharing agreements.

Using CAPTCHA and honesty primes to increase tax collection in Guatemala,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/424,"July 11, 2014",2014-06-30 12:58:12 -0400,AEARCTR-0000424,"Michael  Sanders, michael.sanders@behaviouralinsights.co.uk",in_development,2014-07-27,2015-03-31,"[""finance"", ""governance"", """"]","","This trial involves prompting and priming honesty among Guatemalan taxpayers filing declarations for income tax (ISR) or value added tax (IVA). Messages designed to induce more honest declarations are included as part of a series of CAPTCHA security systems which participants must complete in order to complete their declaration forms for these taxes.
The primary objective of the trial is to increase honesty in tax declaration. Following previous research in this area, we argue that more honest declarations will typically be report a higher tax liability than dishonest ones. The trial is important as Guatemala has the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America (OECD, 2014).
The trial involves all people eligible to pay at least one of four taxes who complete a tax return online between July and November 2014 (approximately 1,600,000 individuals), who will be randomly allocated to either see one of six honesty prompts, or be part of a control group. Unlike other studies of tax compliance, this study targets people who are in the process of declaring their tax, rather than late or non-payers.
The intervention is delivered at the point of accessing an online declaration form. Participants are required to complete a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that verifies that they are a human being completing the form rather than an automated process. Our interventions consist of a series of messages inserted into the CAPTCHA pop-up. 
The trial aims to test the differential impact of the original CAPTCHA (which contains no behavioural prompts), and various prompts inspired by behavioural science. These include an honesty declaration, information about public goods paid for by taxes and punishment for noncompliance, and allowing participants to choose what they believe to be a good use for public funds, or an appropriate punishment. We hypothesise that these primes will induce more honest (higher) tax declarations through various cognitive channels. 
",2014-07-27,2014-12-05,"The objective of this trial can be framed in one of two ways – to increase tax revenues in Guatemala, and to encourage more honesty in the declaration of tax liabilities. 
For the purposes of this trial we take the two measures to be equivalent. Following Shu et al (2012), we assume that if a participant is reporting their tax liability dishonestly (as opposed to making an error), they will systematically understate their liability relative to the truth. We further assume that misreporting through error is statistically similar to classical measurement error, and so is randomly distributed around the true value according to some unknown distribution. For the purposes of our power calculations, we assume that this error is (a) classical (b) orthogonal on treatment, and (c) does not interact with treatment – i.e. that the measurement error does not effect treatment. If (a) does not hold, we may experience a loss of power, and any treatment effect detected would be a lower bound on the true effect size; (b) holds by design of the trial, and the validity of (c) is irrelevant if (b) holds. 
Hence, total tax liability declared is our primary outcome measure.
","","We adopt a randomised controlled trial design with parallel conditions and individual level randomisation. Participants (Guatemalans declaring their tax liability), will be randomly assigned to see one of 7 CAPTCHAs (control or one of the six treatment arms) after selecting the tax form to fill in on the main Declaraguate website, and before the form page.
This trial will be conducted over the course of 4 months. There are four types of tax included in this trial described below . The trial involves approximately 4% of Guatemalans, and all Guatemalans who declare online for these four tax regimes. For income tax and VAT general this is 100% of declarations as online declaration is mandatory for these tax regimes, for VAT small taxpayers approximately 90% of declarations are made online.

For income tax and VAT general this is 100% of declarations as online declaration is mandatory for these tax regimes, for VAT small taxpayers approximately 90% of declarations are made online.
It is reasonable to assume that our interventions may have differing effects for taxpayers declaring for the four different regimes. For this reason we produce separate results for each type of tax in our trial. This will be described in more detail later in this protocol. As well as our primary analytical objectives (determining whether more tax has been paid), we aim to gain insights into the behavioural mechanisms in action and to identify the medium-term effects of messaging (over the course of the four months of the trial). We note that choices of tax are fixed within the period of the trial, and so although these are endogenous they do not interfere with our analysis. 
Income Tax 
Guatemalan income tax is charged in one of two ways, selected by the taxpayer. The two taxes are paid differently (using different forms), and we are considering both in this trial.
Regime over profits from lucrative activities
Taxpayers can choose to pay income tax in this way. This is charged at a rate of 28% on non-deductible income. Deductions include income from capital. This tax must be paid every 3 months, with returns filed within ten days of the end of the quarter.
Simplified optional regime over income from lucrative activities
Participants in this scheme pay 7% of their annual income in taxation (from April 2014). Participants in this tax regime must make monthly tax returns not later than the 10th of the subsequent month, and an aggregated return to be completed annually. 
There are good reasons to expect different treatment effects depending on the tax being declared. The regime over profits from lucrative activities is charged at a higher rate, and so the incentive to behave dishonestly may be higher. Individuals and businesses that complete this kind of return may however be more affluent, which in turn could reduce their incentive to be dishonest due to a lower marginal value of money
Finally, the simplified option is, as its name implies, less complex a form. This may lead to greater honesty as there are fewer dimensions across which it is possible to obfuscate tax liability.
Value Added Tax (VAT)
Two regimes exist for Value Added Tax (VAT) payments in Guatemala. VAT is levied at 12% for taxpayers under the general regime (with annual turnover of more than GTQ 150,000), and 5% for taxpayers in the small taxpayers regime (with annual turnover of less than GTQ 150,000) . VAT is charged on sales of goods within the country, sale of services in the country, any imported goods, leasing contracts, transfers of real estate, and insurance and bond sales. Exports, banking activities, payments in-kind, mergers, trade in financial instruments, and trust arrangements are exempt from VAT. We consider taxpayers under both regimes. Similar to income tax we have reason to expect differential treatment impacts for taxpayers under the two VAT regimes.

Evidence in this area is currently sparse and, where it does exist, is inconsistent. As such this research will have significant implications for future policy making and funding decisions in this area.
The two primary questions that this trial aims to answer are:
1.	Does taking part in the CF programme boost the employability of participants?

2.	Are participants’ general skills (as measured by this trial), improved by taking part in the CF programme?

We expect that approximately 36 schools will take part in the trial, with and average of 30 participating students from each school. If this will be the case, 20 schools (600 students) will be randomly assigned to the treatment group and 16 schools (480 students) to the control group.
For conservative estimates of the minimum detectable effect size, we chose a baseline mean for binary and continuous outcomes of 50% - the point at which the baseline variance is at its greatest for first type of outcome. For continuous outcomes, we chose a baseline variance of 0.04 (a standard deviation of 0.2). This is suitable for outcomes such as test scores out of 100, where a standard deviation of 20% about a mean of 50% is conservative.
The table below shows our calculation of the minimum detectable effect size for this trial design for a power of 80%. We also assume a significance level of 5% and an intra-cluster correlation rate of 0.02 (as is standard for trials in schools).

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of otilonium bromide in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
Methods: The study was initiated as randomized and prospective in single center by experienced endoscopists. The patients were randomized into spasmolytic and control groups. In spasmolytic group, patients were administered 80 mg of otilonium bromide orally, 2 hours before the procedure. The control group took no medicine. 
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed under topical anesthesia without any sedation. The endoscopist evaluated the motility and tolerability of the procedure. Moreover, another person evaluated the patients’ comments on the procedure. 
Results: There were 400 patients included into the study (257 female and 143 male). The mean age was 51.8 years. In the spasmolytic group, the tolerability of the procedure was evaluated as bad in 10%, moderate in 38% and good and very good in 52% of the procedures. In the control group, those rates were 21%, 53.5% and 30%, respectively (p<0.001).
In the spasmolytic group, intestinal motility was evaluated as no in 13%, mild in 70% and moderate in 17% of the procedures. In the control group the rates were as follows: 11.5%, 53.5% and 35% (p<0.001).
Conclusions: Otilonium bromide decreases the intestinal motility and can be used safely as a spasmolytic before the upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy. It can ease the procedure both for the endoscopist and the patient.

We also saw changes in agricultural management practices and decreased reliance on other farmers and input dealers for agricultural information. While agricultural practices seem to have changed, the average respondent did not demonstrate improved average knowledge.

Understanding the resource curse: A survey experiment in Tanzania,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/768,"July 10, 2015",2015-07-10 16:17:23 -0400,AEARCTR-0000768,"Ingrid Sjursen, ingrid.sjursen@nhh.no",in_development,2015-07-09,2015-08-15,"[""governance"", """"]","","Tanzania has discovered large reservoirs of off shore natural gas, and might become a large exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) during the next decades. With this comes the promise of significant petro-revenues to the Tanzanian government, and prospects of improved economic and social conditions for the country's population. However, the empirical literature suggests that natural resource wealth constitutes a considerable challenge. Natural resource wealth is associated with lower economic growth (Sachs and Warner 1995, Sachs and Warner 1999, Mehlum et al. 2006); prolonged authoritarian regimes  (Aslaksen 2010, Ross 2001, 2009, Tsui 2011, Andersen and Aslaksen 2013); corruption (Vicente 2010, Leite and Weidmann 2002, Treismann 2007, Busse and Gröning 2013); and violent conflict (Collier and Hoeffler 2004).

While there seems to be a consensus that such a thing as a ""resource curse"" exists, there is large heterogeneity in the economic, social and political outcomes of natural resource wealth. Researchers have proposed different channels that can explain these diverging experiences. The present study will draw on the political economy literature that focuses on the quality of institutions, governance and democracy (Ross 2015, Busse and Gröning 2013). This research project aims to contribute to the scarce body of micro-level empirical investigations of the resource curse by investigating the effect of natural resource rents the political attitudes and behavior of citizens. In addition to look at citizens willingness to pay tax and engage in corrupt activities, we will also examine people's trust in the government. While trust has been shown to be an important determinant of economic growth, we have not found any studies investigating the effect of natural resource rents on the level of trust in a society.

The research questions we seek to answer are the following: How do expectations about resource revenues in a country affect
- people's willingness to pay taxes?
- people's willingness to engage in corrupt/rent-seeking activities?
- people's trust in the government?

To answer these questions, we will conduct a survey experiment that will also include incentivised games. In the experiment, respondents will first answer some key background questions. They are then randomly assigned to a control or one of four treatment groups. In all treatments, we will provide information about the estimated total value of the gas revenues, but how the totals are illustrated will be varied. We use a 2x2 design to study if the results are sensitive to whether the revenues are illustrated (a) in per capita or population terms and (b) in totals or in terms of the interest that can be generated in infinity if the money is saved. 

The information manipulation is important both from a policy perspective, since it may inform policy-makers about the impact of how different informational responses may affect the public, but also because it may shed light on how the different informational approaches affect the mindset of people. 

The purpose of the treatments is to generate exogenous variation in expectations about gas revenues, by increasing the salience of existing expectations among those who already know about them, and by creating expectations among those who do not know about gas revenues.
After receiving the treatment or control group information, respondents answer a series of questions intended to capture willingness to pay taxes, willingness to engage in corruption and trust in the government. The treatment manipulations allow us to study the causal effect of increased expectations about gas revenues on willingness to pay tax and to engage in corrupt activities, as well as trust in the government by simply reminding the participants in the treatment conditions about the fact that Tanzania has discovered large reservoirs of natural gas.

In the last part of the experiment, respondents an incentivised game. We have developed two games. The first game intends to measure trust in other citizens in economic decisions. The second game intends to measure cheating behavior (proxy for willingness to engage in corrupt activities). The incentivised games provide us with behavioral measures of how information about gas revenues, and the way in which it is presented, affects trust and cheating behavior in society.

In this section we describe the basic experimental setup common to all experiments we ran in this study. Auditors were recruited via the employee networks of the Center for Microfinance (CMF), with the goal of recruiting reliable, capable individuals who would be able to conduct the audits effectively. 
The audit team was led by a full-time audit manager, who had previously worked managing a financial product sales team for an international bank. This employee, along with a principal investigator, provided intensive introductory training on life insurance. Each auditor was subsequently trained in the specific scripts they were to follow when meeting with the agents. Each auditor's script was customized to match the auditor's true-life situation (number of children, place of residence, etc.). However, auditors were given uniform and consistent language to use when asking about insurance products and seeking recommendations. Auditors memorized the scripts, as they would be unable to use notes in their meetings with the agents. 
Following each interview, auditors completed an exit interview form immediately, which was entered and checked for consistency. The auditors and their manager were told neither the purpose of the study nor the specific hypotheses we sought to test. Auditors were instructed not to lie during any of the sessions. The audit process was designed to mimic customer behavior as much as possible, and allow our auditors to act naturally. The audits scripts were written by a former life insurance salesperson, with the goal of representing typical transactions.
Following pilots, we ran a series of experiments to understand under what circumstances advice might improve. In each experiment, treatments were randomly assigned to auditors, and auditors to agents. Note that because the randomizations were done independently, this means that each auditor did not necessarily do an equivalent number of treatment and control audits for any given intervention of interest. Since we were identifying agents as the experiment proceeded, we randomized in daily batches. To ensure treatment fidelity, auditors were assigned to use only one particular treatment script on a given day.
Life insurance agents were identified via a number of different sources, most of which were websites with national listings of life insurance agents. Contact procedures were identical across the treatments. While some agents were visited more than once, care was taken to ensure that no auditor visited the same agent twice, and to space any repeat visits at least four weeks apart, both to minimize the burden on the agents and to reduce the chance that the agent would learn of the study. At the experiments' conclusion, auditors were offered a bonus which they could use towards purchasing a life insurance plan of their own choosing.
THE THREE EXPERIMENTS
Below we describe the audit counts from our three experiments, disaggregated by treatment combinations. The first column provides the total number of audits for each treatment combination, the second column provides the total number of auditors involved for each treatment combination, and the third column provides the number of distinct agents visited for each treatment combination. The fourth column indicates the mean of the main dependent variable, by treatment assignment, for each experiment. a) Since agents may have been visited by more than one auditor, the number of agents visited is less than the total number of audits.

The EpC is a half-day after-school program with monthly ""school for parents"" meetings.

Research has demonstrated that handwashing with soap prevents pneumonia and diarrhea, but lack of soap provisions and limited piped water infrastructure makes handwashing practices difficult. To make the process of handwashing more convenient, Innovations for Poverty Action has redesigned an existing tippy-tap handwashing system to create a more functional, durable, and innovative handwashing system. The result is a water-efficient, soap-frugal handwashing station that is portable and adaptable to multiple settings. The innovative soap foam dispenser conserves soap by dispensing tactile foam and the water tap is easy to use and conserves water.

This study will assess household willingness to pay for the redesigned handwashing system in peri-urban communities in Kisumu, Kenya.

The study will be conducted in a series of cycles. A cycle is composed of the following three stages: community meeting, offer stage, and refund stage. The study will be conducted in cycles to provide multiple opportunities for all vouchers to be used. For example, if 40 households express interest in purchasing a handwashing product during the first cycle but only 15 households actually use their voucher to purchase a handwashing station, the remaining unused vouchers will be distributed to interested households during the second cycle. The cycle method also allows us to offer the handwashing products at different times during the year to account for potential constraints such as school fees, holidays, etc. We will continue additional cycles until either all the coupons are used or until budget constraints arise.

","","Selection of Trading Center Sample
We begin sample selection from a group of 110 subcounties in 11 districts of Uganda that were identified by AgriNet as being opportune markets for implementation of the project.  These are areas that are generally food surplus and are close enough to national road infrastructure to be feasible for long-distance trade, while not being already well integrated into the national commercial food supply system.  

Within these 110 subcounties we did a census of markets, focusing particularly on the full-time ‘trading centers’ (TCs) at which local intermediaries have their warehouses, rather than the weekly ‘markets’ that are typically used by locals for buying perishable foods but are not centers of selling grain harvests.  On average we located just over two such trading centers per subcounty.  

We then divided these TCs into two types:  ‘hub’ markets, which are connected to national trunk infrastructure and serve as the core trading location for their areas, and ‘spokes’ that are local markets trading primarily with their respective hub.  We eliminated TCs that lack access to mobile networks (a core component of our interventions), and eliminated spokes for which there was no obvious hub (unless there were fewer than 2 other TCs per perish, in which case these unmapped TCs were kept in our sample), and sampled so that we have no more than two spokes per parish.  The final sample consists of 240 TCs that are divided into 20 ‘wheels’, where a wheel consists of a hub and its component spokes.  

We drew in 24 additional TCs to be able to collect price data on them; 20 of these are a set of hubs and spokes in districts that are near to the study districts but not directly connected to them by market linkages.  These are intended to serve as a ‘pure control’ to check for contamination of study control markets by activities in the treatment.  We also drew in the four major national markets so as to have comparable price data in the most important national trading centers for the SMS Blast system; these are Kampala (capital), Kabale (border with Rwanda),  Busia (border with Kenya), and Arua (border with DRC & South Sudan).  The total number of markets reporting the biweekly Market Survey is thus 264.

Experimental design.
The unit of randomization is the sub-county.  In order to create a 2x2 design at the spoke level (is the spoke treated, is the hub treated) we blocked the design by whether the sub-county contains a hub (17%) or not (83%), and we stratified by a sub-county level price index (mean of the z-scores of the prices of each of our four crops at the trading centers in each sub-county).  

This creates a design in which half of the hubs are treated and half are not, but there is random variation in the fraction of spokes for each hub that are treated.  The final sample then consists of 55 treated sub-counties and 55 control sub-counties.  With 210 CAs located in these 55 treated subcounties, on average there are 3.8 CAs per treated sub-county.   

Trader and Farmer Survey Sampling.
The 240 study trading centers serve as the Primary Sampling Unit for a set of farming household and trader surveys.  On average we conducted 5 trader surveys and 11 households per trading center.  Traders were randomly sampled from the universe of individuals who operated as permanent entrepreneurs in each trading center.  In addition, we conduct the trader survey with the 210 AgriNet CAs who are participating in the study.

The household survey was conducted as follows.  First, for each study subcounty, we listed all the Local Councils (LC1s) in the sub-county.  We then divided these into the LC1s that contain a study trading center (which are likely to be more urban) and those that do not (which are rural).  We then selected the LC1 containing the trading center, and randomly sampled one of the LC1s that do not contain the trading center.  For these two LC1s, we then listed all the households based on administrative records held by the LC1 chairperson, and randomly sampled households from these lists.  We imposed two eligibility criteria:  the household had to be engaged in agriculture, and had in the previous year to have sold some quantity of any of the four crops included in the study.

However, the causes of these price disparities are poorly understood.  How much is due to transaction costs -- for instance, poor roads and infrastructure, high search costs, and limited contract enforcement -- and how much is due to imperfect competition among private sector actors in these markets -- that is, to the ability of intermediaries to exert market power and drive prices away from competitive equilibria? The answer to this question has important implications for the type of market integration policies that should be promoted in order to have the greatest impact on price convergence and welfare.  This study has two aims: first, to quantify how competitive rural agricultural markets are, and, second, to test whether the entry of new intermediaries into markets can enhance competition among traders and increase consumer welfare.",2015-02-16,2015-06-05,"The primary outcome measure for both stages of the experiment are prices and quantities of maize sold in the market.  These will be collecting in detailed transaction-level surveys.  These outcomes will be used to estimate pass-through, demand elasticities, and underlying marginal costs.","","Pass-through -- that is, how a reduction in traders' costs is passed-through to a reduction in the price at which they sell to consumers -- can reveal much about the competitiveness of a market.  If markets are perfectly competitive, then any reduction in costs faced by all traders should be passed on in full to consumers, as competing traders underbid each other until the price has dropped by the exact reduction in costs.  However, if markets are not perfectly competitive, then the reduction in costs will not be perfectly passed through to the price faced by consumers, as traders account for the fact that any reduction in price will affect quantity sold as well.  Moreover, the amount by which the pass-through deviates from 100% gives us a quantifiable measure of the level of competition.

The first stage of this study executes exactly this experiment -- offering an exogenous shock to costs in the form of a per-bag subsidy offered to traders -- in order to measure pass-through.  If possible, this experiment may simultaneously also allow us to estimate the underlying demand function; if we are underpowered to do this, we will also run a separate experiment to estimate demand directly.  From this, we will be able to back out parameters summarizing competition and strategic interaction among intermediaries in the market.  To do this, we will take the following specific steps outlined in the design registry document.

The second stage of this experiment attempts to measure the impact of entry on competition.  In this stage, we encourage (randomly selected) traders to enter (randomly selected) markets in which they do not currently work, by providing a subsidy that is conditional on entry.  Reduced form impacts on prevailing price and quantity sold will be measured by comparison to control market-days.

Recent evidence about how being concerned with scarcity induces tunneling—channeling one’s mental bandwidth for decisions involving that dimension in which the individual faces scarcity—suggest that insurance might also play a different role: by making farmers less sensitive to stimuli that trigger water scarcity being top of mind, rainfall insurance might shield farmer’s psychology from tunneling effects. This means that insured farmers might display higher attention, memory and impulse control for decisions unrelated to water (and the converse for those involving water) when compared to uninsured farmers. This paper randomly assigns rainfall insurance to family farmers in a drought-prone region in Northeast Brazil, documenting its effects on economic decisions related and unrelated to water, and on brain's executive functions.",2015-03-09,2015-06-20,"We document the effects of our treatments on 5 types of outcomes:

(2) Economic decisions unrelated to water, e.g.: decisions in hypothetical experiments, including patience, trust and reciprocity in non-water related tasks; 

(3) Cognitive performance in tasks related to water, e.g.: sensitivity to framing and attention and memory in water-related tests;

(4) Cognitive performance in tasks unrelated to water, e.g.: sensitivity to framing and attention and memory in non-water related tests;

For cognitive outcomes, we consider two versions of each: penalized by response time over the phone, and not penalized.

We will include municipality fixed-effects in order to control for fixed unobservable factors, in particular different random assignment probabilities (since the number of eligible farmers in each municipality is unknown). We will cluster standard errors at the individual-level.

We will convert all outcomes to z-scores and take the average of them within each type, using those averages as dependent variables besides analyzing each outcome in isolation.","When farmers start making production-related decisions, but before uncertainty is resolved – in early March –, we will provide two randomly assigned treatments. First, we will enroll 1,000 farmers in Government-subsidized insurance (Treatment 1). Second, half our subjects will be randomly assigned to a drought-related message at the begging of each automated voice call (interactive voice response unit, IVR) through which we run the survey (Treatment 2), while the others will listen to neutral message. 

We expect the drought-related message to prime farmers about water scarcity, making water top-of-mind with a higher likelihood for uninsured farmers. In principle, insurance should shield farmers’ psychology from the scarcity environment (at least partially).

Power calculations for some outcomes of interest are based on the results of the June wave of the 2014 pilot. Calculations of minimum detectable effects assume 10%, 5% or 1% statistical significance, 80% statistical power, a sample size of 5,000 farmers, 50% of non-response rate (also based on the average for the 2014 pilot) and 50% random assignment to priming about rainfall (a crucial element of the experiments). Given these parameters, minimum detectable effects (in absolute value) are given by:
|MDE|=(t_(1-κ)+t_alpha ) √(σ^2/p(1-p)   x 4/NxW)  ,
Where t_(1-κ) is the t-statistic associated with confidence level 1-κ, t_α is the t-statistic associated with power α, σ is the standard deviation of the effect, p is the proportion of the 5, observations in the treatment group, N is the number of observations, and W is the number of waves. The term  4/NxW incorporates the 50% non-response rate and the 50% random assignment to priming about rainfall, which divide the effective number of observations by a factor of 4.

Under 10% and 5% significance, both the two- and five-wave designs would be able to detect the effects for Digit span, Garbled words, and price recall of beans and corn. The five-wave design would be very close to detecting the effect of the treatment on recall of goat average prices. Under 1% significance, the two-wave design would no longer be able to detect the effect of the treatment on the score of Garbled words, while the five-wave design would still be able to detect it.
None of the two designs would be able to detect the effect of the treatment on Stroop scores in week 1 or on recall of goat prices in week 2. Having said that, the estimated effects for the June wave were very small, so it might as well be that such effects are not statistically significant after the planting stage, when uncertainty about rainfall has been resolved. As an illustration, we estimated a four-fold effect of the treatment on stoop scores in the March wave.
It follows that the number of waves is binding in this design in what comes to detecting the effects of interest, particularly with respect to Garbled words, the one task representing the “focus dividend” of tunneling in our 2014 pilot.

Achieving Universal Health Coverage with an Unenforceable Mandate: Evidence from the Government of Indonesia's JKN Mandiri Program,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/815,"October 21, 2015",2015-10-21 09:48:18 -0400,AEARCTR-0000815,"Benjamin Olken, bolken@mit.edu",on_going,2014-11-03,2016-12-31,"[""health"", """"]","","Law 40/2004 on the National Social Security System and Law 24/2011 on Social Security Carriers (BPJS) outlined Indonesia’s path towards the creation of a universal social security system. A primary goal is to achieve universal health coverage through a mandatory public health insurance scheme – Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN). Begun in January 2014, JKN aims to achieve total coverage by 2019.

JKN coverage is determined by household’s income and employment status. The Government of Indonesia (GoI) covers the insurance premia of the poor and near-poor, while wage workers premia are covered jointly by the employee and the employer. The toughest challenge will be the registration and retention of non-poor non-wage workers, who have to register for the program and make monthly payments.

Ensuring non-wage worker participation is especially difficult: not only is it harder for the government to locate these individuals and encourage them to sign up, but the fact that they have to bear the cost of their premia, and remit it directly to the government each monthly, decreases the probability that they would sign up. 

The main objective of this project is to rigorously test potential strategies to increase the participation of non-poor informal workers into the insurance scheme. We focus on incentives to enroll at the household level and explore three main factors that could potentially be hindering participation: monetary costs, hassle costs and lack of information. Moreover, we test for adverse selection by looking at whether different incentives attract different types of people.",2014-11-03,2015-12-31,"The first key outcome is enrollment or how each of the treatment affects the take-up of JKN. Relatedly, we will look at how different treatment affect the premium payment behavior. In addition, we will look at health care seeking behavior in the form of outpatient and inpatient claims from administrative data. Lastly, we will look at how pre-existing variables differ across treatments. The variables we will focus on are pre-trial health care system utilization together with demographic variables.","","The trial consists of four different treatment arms, that will be all cross-cut with each other. Firstly, we will randomly assign households to different subsidy levels. Some households will receive a 50% subsidy in the form of a buy-one-get-one free bonus (if the family enrolls, they only have to pay the premium for half of the family members), some households will receive a full subsidy and some households will receive a no inpatient bonus (the household has to cover the full premium for all family members but, if they have no inpatient claim for a year, receive 50% of the premiums they paid back). The remaining households will receive no subsidy. Secondly, we will offer to half of the households the possibility to register on the spot as opposed to following the procedure that requires them to go to a central office. Thirdly, we will test three different information treatments focusing on health care costs of certain illnesses, a waiting period, and potential penalties for non-enrollment. Lastly, we will also vary the length of time for which the subsidy offer is valid (Medan only).","",Randomization done in the field on a computer using CSPro ,Households,2000 households in Medan and 4750 households in Bandung.,2000 households in Medan and 4750 households in Bandung.,"The study has 4 main treatments to test. All treatments will be cross-cut one to another. In Medan, all treatments had equal probability. In Bandung a higher number of households (2500) will be assigned to the treatment group; 1000 households will be assigned to the half subsidy and no inpatient bonus and 500 households will be assigned to the full subsidy treatment. All other treatments have equal probability.","The analysis for this study will be divided into two main parts. First, we estimate the effect that the different incentives schemes have on enrollment into JKN. This uses the entire sample. Second, we study whether different incentives schemes attract different individuals and differentially affect individuals’ health seeking behavior. To perform this analysis, we compare families which took up across different treatments. This part of the analysis restricts the sample to taker-uppers.

As a result, we perform two sets of power calculations. Power calculations for enrollment use the entire sample and, in particular, the size of groups assigned to each treatment. Given the number of individuals assigned to each group, we calculate a predicted number of taker-uppers for each treatment group based on the enrollment rates that we saw in the previous pilot. We then use these group sizes for all power calculations related to adverse selection or health seeking behavior.

All power calculations calculate MDEs based on control means and standard deviations from the previous pilot. We assume β=0.80 and α=0.05. All MDEs are expressed as fraction of control group standard deviation.

Overall, for the Bandung pilot, MDEs for the enrollment regressions are in the order of 0.10 to 0.20 standard deviations, whereas MDEs for the adverse selection regressions are in the order of 0.20 to 0.40 standard deviations.

The tables (uploaded separately) report the assumptions on take-up rates and MDEs for the different treatment arms and main outcomes of interest. Note that these MDEs are lower bounds for the onsite registration treatment and for the half-subsidy and full-subsidy treatment. These treatments are the same in the Medan and in the Bandung pilot, which means that we will be able to pool together the data from the two sites in the analysis."
Information and user choice in primary health care markets,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/659,"May 08, 2015",2015-05-08 04:55:09 -0400,AEARCTR-0000659,"Gustav Kjellsson, gustav.kjellsson@economics.gu.se",on_going,2015-02-04,2016-08-31,"[""health"", """"]","","In order to increase quality of care, all regions in Sweden have during the last decade implemented systems where users can choose their primary health care provider, and where there is freedom of establishment for providers. All primary health care units are financed by public means and pre-set user fees, but may be privately or publicly run. For user choice systems to improve the functioning of health care, users must choose health care units that deliver care of relatively high-quality. Previous studies indicate that a very large share of users in Sweden do not compare the quality of providers before making their choice of provider. The transaction costs related to information retrieval and switching present a possible obstacle to the functioning of this market: the gathering of information about and comparison of providers is costly in terms of time, and there are also (small) process costs related to notifying providers of the change. In this study, we provide three randomly drawn samples of the population in the region of Skåne with information about the quality of primary care providers, to see whether this freely available information affects their propensity to change provider, and the type of provider they choose. The first sample is representative of the whole population in the region (above 18 years of age),  the second consists of individuals that have recently moved to the region, and the third sample consists of families that are expecting children. We also examine if lowering the process costs on top of providing free information affects the choice frequency, and whether the effects differ for groups defined by for example socioeconomic background and health status.",2015-02-24,2015-09-01,"The outcome variables of main interest are the frequency of choice, and the type of primary care providers chosen by users in our samples.","","The premise for Part 1 is that the regional health authority has to treat all primary care centers equally, in order to be neutral in terms of competition on this market. Using the random number generator within Stata (which we use for all randomizations), we therefore first draw 11 percent of listed individuals over 18 from each of the 150 primary care centers. Then, we randomly select 9.0909091 percent of these 11 percent, which constitute the treatment group. In total, this procedure implies that 1 percent of the total population over 18 will be treated. The remaining 10 percent constitutes the control group. Among the treatment group, we then randomly assign 25 percent to the group that only receives information (T1), and 75 percent to the group that receives information and a pre-paid change form (T2).

Several details about how we will conduct the randomization for Part 2 and 3 are presently not known. We will use a cluster randomized trial for Part 3, but a detailed description of the procedure will have to be added at a later date.

The Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá (CCB) conducts workshops for prospective formal-sector entrants and arranges personalized meetings for them with CCB agents. The CCB’s decision to significantly reduce the transaction costs of registration and the entry into force of Act No. 1429 of 2010, which eliminated the costs of the initial procedure for registering as a formal enterprise and provided exemptions from relevant taxes during the first years after formalization, provided us with an ideal experiment for studying how the elimination of the initial fixed costs of formalization would influence firms’ decision to operate formally or not. We obtained two important results. First, while a workshop treatment had no effect on firms’ formalization decisions, meetings at the firm with CCB agents raised the likelihood that a business would begin to operate formally by 5.5 percentage points for all the firms that were invited, at random, to participate in this arm of the intervention and by 32 percentage points for the firms that accepted the invitation. Second, the effect on the treatment firms did not persist over time. After a year of formal operation, it disappeared. These results indicate that substantial reductions in the fixed costs of operating formally are not effective in formalization choices, since such reductions had no lasting effect on formalization decisions. ",2011-10-01,2012-03-30,"Decision to operate formally at the firm level gathered from administrative records from the Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá, Colombia. ","","Firms were randomly assigned to the target groups for the two interventions or to a control group. One of the interventions consisted of workshops run by CCB instructors. The CCB invites informal-sector entrepreneurs to these workshops so that it can provide them with information about the advantages and disadvantages of operating formally. It also provides information about the registration process. Workshops of this type had never been offered before in the area of Bogotá where the firms in our sample are located, and the CCB agreed not to hold any additional workshops there until after our study was completed. The workshops that took place during our study were held at the local CCB office in Restrepo, which was close to the firms included in our sample. 
The workshop included: (1) a description of what formality in Colombia entails; (2) a discussion of the advantages of operating in the formal sector, including  the possibility of doing more and better business with other formal-sector firms, of attending free training courses and of receiving assistance from the CCB to improve the way in which the business was being managed; (3) instructions about how to navigate the registration process; and (4) examples of successful firms that started out in the informal sector but  then moved into the formal sector of the economy.
The workshop lasted two hours and then allowed for additional time to provide more information about the registration process to interested entrepreneurs. The person in charge of providing this information to the entrepreneurs then contacted them by telephone in order to arrange a meeting at the CCB to start off the registration procedure. This follow-up support began at the time that the entrepreneur expressed interest in registration after the workshop and ended when the firm obtained its business license. 
The second intervention consisted of personalized visits to interested firms by CCB agents who gave them the same information that was imparted at the workshop and assisted them with the registration process if they wished to have that type of support. As is also true of the workshop, this kind of program is a regular activity of the CCB. The firms included in our sample had never received these kinds of visits, however, and an arrangement had been made with the CCB not to make such visits again until the experiment was over. The CCB-trained agents visited entrepreneurs after having phoned them and, if they agreed, setting a date and time for the visit. The CCB does not send agents to visit entrepreneurs unless they agree to meet with a CCB agent during the initial phone call. After the first visit, which is for information purposes only, CCB agents return only to the firms that agree to register.

Using a randomized controlled trial, we allocate employees to different experimental conditions where ideas can be submitted to an innovation challenge for further support and development.

Anticarrots and Athletic Gym Membership,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/650,"May 28, 2015",2015-05-28 14:22:44 -0400,AEARCTR-0000650,"Ian Ayres, ian.ayres@yale.edu",in_development,2015-06-01,2017-09-01,"[""health"", ""welfare"", """"]",D03,"This experiment will test whether the experience of resisting temptation to quit an activity or task boosts subjects’ determination to complete that task.  

We pursue this question through a collaboration with a gym to randomly offer some new members the chance to give up their membership and have their membership fee refunded.  Our hypothesis is that those who are presented with and resist the temptation will come to the gym more often and renew their membership at higher rates.  In particular, we want to test whether the group of people who are offered a temptation to quit the gym ends up exercising more – even after including (in our intent to treat analysis) those students who accept the temptation and quit their gym membership.

By rejecting a temptation a person is able to learn something about herself, which in turn will increase her commitment to a certain activity or task.   Bénabou and Tirole (2004) map a theoretical framework for “willpower activities” like resisting temptation.  They hypothesize that resisting temptation is “hard” information that even people with imperfect recall about their state of mind—for example, being committed to going to the gym—can use to build an enduring image of themselves.   Resisting the temptation provides the actor information about his ability to commit to a course of action and hence about the likelihood of success. This new information will, in turn, make it easier and more attractive to stay on the task rather than quitting.  Our experiment will test this theory.
",2015-08-01,2016-12-31,"Primary: Decision to quit, satisfaction with gym, decision to extend gym subscription after initial gym contract ends, frequency of attending the gym (at week, month, semester, year frequencies), and various measures of subsequent academic achievement and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes will include tests of heterogeneous treatment effects with regard to several pre-treatment variables, including: language, gender, marital status, postcode of residence, work-study status, academic degree, academic major, academic year, academic grades, number of credits per semester, level of difficulty of academic classes, number of classes. ","","The experiment focuses on new members at the gym, who have already demonstrated additional interest in exercising by going to the gym twice in the first week of their memberships.  We limit our subjects to this population because these new members have a commitment level that is high enough that they are likely to resist our temptations but still malleable and subject to updating based on new information about themselves.  ","The experiment flow is as follows:

1.	A new member signs up at gym and signs a contract that includes a section or clause about academic experiments.  This is their consent to participate in the study.
2.	On their second visit to the gym within a week of registering, one-third of these new members will be randomly presented at a computer terminal with one of three treatments. Members assigned to each treatment group will see a different initial screen; all members will then be shown a screen asking the member to rate his or her satisfaction with them gym. The treatments are shown in either English or Dutch depending on the member’s initial language selection. The treatments have been described above in the ""intervention"" section.

3.	The experiment design limits the number of “quits” by asking the members at the beginning of their membership while they are still excited about their new commitment.  It also does so by asking them as they enter the gym prepared to work out, which may dissuade them from quitting, workout bag in hand.  In the data, those who quit will be marked as having 0 visits and as not renewing their contract.

4.	The system should block new subscriptions within three months from those who have accepted the offer. There should be a procedure to check that other gyms do not try to bypass this ban.

5.	The system will allow the researcher to stop the experiment in three ways: (i) if we decide to do so; (ii) automatically if the number of cancellations for a specific contract type exceeds a certain threshold (the system will allow us to set different thresholds for different contract types); (iii) automatically if the total refunds for cancelled subscriptions exceed a certain threshold (the system will alert the gym and the researchers if total refunds have reached 80% of the limit).



We will match gym outcome data with academic survey outcomes from the following national survey in Holland: 

http://www.studiekeuzeinformatie.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Vastgestelde-vragenlijst-NSE-2015-Eng.pdf

The survey includes sections asking students to rate their satisfaction levels (on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied, and 6 = Not applicable) with academic programs, for example:

1.	“The academic skills acquired in your study program/The applied research skills acquired
2.	Testing and assessment (e.g. assessment criteria and forms of testing)
3.	Program schedules
4.	Study load
5.	Other facilities and study environment
6.	The general atmosphere in your study program
7.	The degree to which you are involved in improving your study program”


Students are asked a wide range of other satisfaction-related questions; they include, using the same scale as above:

1.	The level of your study program
2.	The degree to which the content of your study program meets your expectations
3.	The feasibility of deadlines
4.	Student disabilities, illnesses or conditions

The gym data and the university data can be matched using the students' names. Data will be made anonymous after matching is done.
",Randomization is performed by the gym's computer system.,"The assignment is random and immutable, stratified by contract type with treatment assignments for each contract type made in random permuted blocks of size X (where X is the number of active treatment groups). In practice, here is an example with 3 groups: for each contract type, the system randomly assigns every new incoming customer to group A, B or C. The assignment is made in random permuted blocks of 3: this means that when the first new customer for a particular contract type comes in, the system generates a random permutation of the letters {A, B, C}. For instance, if the generated permutation is {B, A, C}, then the customer is assigned to group B. The next customer is assigned to group A and the next one to group C. If a new customer arrives (the fourth customer), the system generates a new permutation. Say, this time it is {B, C, A}, and the system proceeds as before. The system generates a new permutation for every block of three new customers. This procedure is followed for each contract type independently. We should be able to add / delete contract types easily before the experiment starts and to selectively stop the experiment for some contract types and not for others. The assignment is used only for this experiment and is not communicated / visible to the personnel or the customer.

On any week that the lump sum is not paid, the participant is required to pay a fixed amount. The base lump sum payment is either smaller (that is, a negative interest rate), equal to (zero nominal interest rate) or larger than (positive interest) the sum of weekly fixed amounts paid.

We there have two treatments, which together can be combined in six different ways (that is, there are three possible interest rates and two possible weeks for lump sum payment). Each participant in the experiment is randomly offered one of these contracts, and must make a ‘take it or leave it’ decision whether to accept.

","Poverty Prime:
 
 
We have adapted the poverty prime developed by Mani et al. (2013) to the MTurk environment. Participants are randomly assigned to either get the poverty prime or to get the placebo.

Participants who receive the poverty prime (placebo) need to explain how they would deal with an income decrease of 20% (5%). We then ask them a variety of questions on whether this income shock would substantially affect their situation and what kind of sacrifices they would need to make. Then, respondents are asked how they would come up with $3000 ($150) on short notice. The order with which these hypothetical scenarios is presented is randomized. Respondents write down how they might deal with the different financial scenarios. The aim of the hard financial scenarios is to trigger feelings of poverty.

We have made two main changes to the primes used by Mani et al. (2013): first, we increased the amounts used in the poverty prime. Second, we removed two financial scenarios because they did not seem well-suited for the MTurk population. We have conducted a pilot study with a sample of 210 participants on August 1st in which we document that our poverty prime makes people more worried with their financial situation. In particular, poorer individuals from our sample are quite strongly affected by our treatment: they are significantly more worried about their financial situation and they are less satisfied with their income level. The primes are further described in Appendix A. Moreover, at the very end of the document, we attach the exact experimental instructions.


Peer Information:

We ran a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk on July 30th in order to get incentivized preference data that we could use as peer group information in the experiment outlined in this pre-analysis plan. We recruited 223 participants out of which 210 participants completed our survey. We asked respondents various questions on their level of risk aversion and time discounting. In particular, we find that 50.25 percent of the sample chose $100 now and 49.75 percent chose $110 in one week. 55 percent of the participants chose $100 for sure, and 45 percent chose the lottery between $70 and $160. We chose those time and risk preference measures for which the preferences over the two different options were most evenly distributed.

Half of our respondents will be randomly assigned to receive information about which option the majority of the respondents in the survey chose. In particular, they  will receive the following message on the page before the behavioral measures:


On the 30th July 2015, we conducted a survey with more than 200 American MTurkers to get some information about their preferences. Like you, these MTurkers come from the US, have completed more than 500 HITs, and have an approval rating of more than 95\%. In the survey, we asked them the same two questions as the ones you will answer now. For each question, we will let you know which option most MTurkers chose. We advertised the survey on the Reddit page ""HitsWorthTurkingFor"" on July 30th. You can check that the survey actually took place by clicking on the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/3f5typ/us_5_minute_experiment_on_economic_preferences.

Subsequently on the page of the time-preference task, the treatment group will be told: Most of the MTurkers who took our previous survey preferred getting $100 today.

Consumer theory offers predictions about the impact of such programs on wellbeing and spending behavior, but there is little real-world evidence. In this paper, we outline the pre-analysis plan for a randomized field experiment to explore the effect of welfare program design on these two key outcomes. We specifically test three design features: 1) workfare versus welfare; 2) restricted versus unrestricted vouchers; and 3) voucher messaging with a focus on spending on oneself or on others. The ten-day experiment involved 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. Each day, subjects either sorted lentils or waited in a room for benefit payments, provided as vouchers to a local grocery store. We either restricted the vouchers to certain basic food items or did not restrict them, and we also randomized voucher messaging. We outline the analysis plan of the impact of these experimental treatments on happiness, productivity, and consumption decisions.",2014-09-22,2014-10-03,"Outcomes I: Expenditures

During the course of the experiment, PBK accepted the vouchers distributed during the experiment and redeemed the value of the vouchers for any item (or the set of restricted items), according to the instructions on each voucher. Vouchers were labeled with ID numbers reflecting the individual’s unique identifier, the treatment group, and the date of issuance in a manner that was not transparent to subjects.

Every time a subject paid for his/her purchases with vouchers, PBK Nonic Supermarket staff stapled the receipt to the voucher. Next, a Busara research assistant with experience conducting randomized field experiments and familiarity with the local culture reviewed the vouchers and attached receipts for errors. The research assistant then collected all vouchers at the end of the day and returned them to the Busara office. 

Participants could redeem their vouchers anytime from the start of the experiment until a week after the experiment concluded. This timeline gave participants up to three full weeks to redeem their vouchers. Through this partnership with PBK Nonic Supermarket, we were able to track the proportion of the vouchers spent on essential versus non-essential goods, along with the voucher type (Self or Family, conditional or unconditional), amount spent, date redeemed, and other information associated with the subject. This data served as basis for the analysis on consumption. 

Outcomes II: Baseline, Daily, and Endline Surveys 

Three survey types were administered during the study. First, on the initial day of the study, participants completed a Baseline survey. The Baseline survey asked questions related to people's current emotions (using a PANAS scale), weekly spending habits, employment, household characteristics, familiarity with the PBK Nonic Supermarket, and decision-making power within the household. 

Second, every day of the study after the initial day, participants completed a Daily survey that asked the same “current emotions” questions from the Baseline survey, but did not include the additional questions in the Baseline survey. 

Third, at the end of the study participants completed an Endline survey, which asked a series of questions on self-esteem, general happiness, and optimism. The Endline survey was designed to measure overall life satisfaction and wellbeing, rather than incidental happiness, enabling us to distinguish between “fleeting” effects of the treatments on wellbeing as opposed to longer run effects on disposition. The Endline survey also asked about family dynamics, income levels, how subjects approached spending the vouchers, and how they felt about their consumption decisions. 

Outcomes III: Effort and Worker Productivity

Two measures of effort and productivity were collected. First, for all treatment groups, attendance and timeliness was tracked by on-site field officers. Second, for the Work treatment only, the productivity of each worker was measured by: 1) weighing of the amount of lentils and rice sorted in the work period; 2) keeping track of the precise time spent sorting for each subject; and 3) computing grams sorted per minute as a proxy for productivity/efficiency. ","","Subjects
The subjects in this experiment were 432 individuals living in the Kawangware area of Nairobi, Kenya, selected at random for recruitment to the study from the subject pool maintained by the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics.

Study Design
The field experiment was conducted in Kawangware, an informal settlement located approximately 15 kilometers from the Nairobi city center. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups, described below, located in three different community halls. Each community hall hosted four sessions per day at the same times each day: 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM, and 3:30 PM. 
After subjects were recruited by phone, they were asked to select one of four time slots during the day for their participation in the study. Once participants were confirmed for a given time slot, they were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and notified of the location where they had to report every day. The assignment to one of three treatment groups were not known to the participants prior to arrival at the location. This design helped avoid any selection bias stemming the time of day that people chose for their participation in the study.

Treatment Groups
Subjects were randomized into three main treatment groups, namely: 
1. Work: People who worked in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of two unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket vouchers.
2. Wait – Unconditional: People who waited in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of two unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket vouchers.
3. Wait – Hybrid: People who waited in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of one unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket voucher and one conditional PBK Nonic Supermarket voucher that could be used for “basic” food items only (Maize/wheat flour, rice, sugar, or cooking oil). 

The total face value of the vouchers provided each day to the subjects was therefore across treatments, and was an amount slightly higher than an average daily wage for most participants.

Despite of the latter, there is evidence that shows that the sole access to saving devices is not necessary related to an increase in savings. Individuals have behavioral problems that limit their savings. Two of them, limited attention and time inconsistency, have proven to be important, as SMS savings remainders and financial instruments with default savings have been effective in increasing the amounts of savings. Therefore, our proposal seeks to execute a randomized impact evaluation of both types of devises in vulnerable population of Chile; a novel investigation as far as the research team is concerned. We will also test the effectiveness of providing savings rule of thumbs, as a mechanism to help individuals to make good decisions with limited bandwidth.  The study will evaluate the effect of these treatments in variables such as formal savings, investment, consumption smoothing, among others, providing important information about financial behavior in low income population. ",2015-08-30,2016-11-30,"To measure those outcomes this evaluation will use two main sources of data: (1) administrative data from the bank and (2) surveys coordinated and executed by the research team or an associated organization. 
1.	Administrative data: During the intervention BancoEstado will weekly send the research team checking and savings accounts information (balances) of all participants, together with banking (number of accounts, date of opening, state and characteristics the accounts) and socioeconomic information that the bank independently collects (this information will be cross-checked with the baseline survey information). Starting in the intervention onwards, every three months, the Bank will also send complete information about the movements of all of the participant’s accounts. This will allow to stufy the effects of the treatments in:
•	Saving and checking account balances
•	Financial behaviour
•	Financial products adquired
2.	Surveys: A baseline survey will be conducted in a tablet device at the moment of the offering. A follow up, household survey will be eventually conducted after one year (funds are still being applied for its execution). A survey firm will be hired to collect that data. The questionnaire will include the following modules:
•	Household member characteristics (gender, age, education)
•	Employment and income
•	Entrepreneurship history
•	Measures of cognitive abilities (such as a digit-span test or a version of a Raven test)
•	Savings and credit behavior
•	Household financial behavior
•	Children’s behaviors (such as labor or school attendance)
•	Female empowerment and self-esteem

","The female empowerment module in the questionnaire addresses both psychological and financial empowerment. Questions regarding the following variables will be included:
Individual characteristics: 
•	Autonomy: Includes initiative to do things, decision making, proactive, how people face new situations. 
•	Auto-efficacy: Personal skills related with self-confidence, how to solve problems, make plans and perseverance. 
•	Locus of control: How people control their own life, for instance the reasons behind success in reaching goals: luck, chances, effort
Financial competences: 
•	Financial system´s knowledge: People familiar with banks, how banks or financial institutions work, their functions, financial products, etc. 
•	Financial literacy: Knowledge of interest rate, inflation, fees, and product´s conditions, etc. 
•	Financial management: How people feel when go to a bank, Capable? Comfortable? Confident? 
 Other variables: 
•	Social support: Relationships, confidence on friends, family, people; variables that are related with asking for help. 
•	Family ambient: Information regarding how family members interact. Discussions, fights, etc.","Regarding the identification strategy, it relies on the random assignment of each eligible individual to a treatment or control group, which guarantees that individuals in each group are, on average, the same. We will use administrative and survey data to test the balance among groups and the effectiveness of the randomization. 

One of the most important stages of the evaluation is the offering process, which will take 3 months in around 25 BancoEstado branches, because it is the only instance (before the follow up survey) when a personal contact with the participants takes place. The participants are offered to participate when they come to the branch to open a savings account, by the same executive in charge of opening it. If the client agrees to participate in the investigation, the executive must provide the consent and the baseline survey (in the tablet device). Once these documents are completed, the executive, with a hidden button in the tablet, must check whether the client should be assigned to one of the ""in situ"" treatments, offering an automatic savings program or showing the educational video. If they are not assigned to any of these treatments, the executive should proceed to open the account desired by the customer.

The equations for this stage is:
Second Stage 
Yij = b0 + b1*T1 + b2*T2 + b3*T3 + a1*Xij + uit
Where Yij is an outcome variable (e.g. amount saved), T1 to T3 are indicators of the treatment status, and Xij is a set of characteristics and dummy variables used in the stratification process. The coefficients b1, b2 and b3 will provide the program effect (as it is currently implemented and with its extension) on the outcome of interest and provide information on the intention to treat. Coefficients significantly different from zero will provide evidence of an effect of the program´s intervention. In particular, we will obtain the effect of each treatment through the following comparisons:
•	b1 = Possessing a savings account and an automatic savings program compared to only having a savings account (control group).
•	b2 =Possessing a savings account and monthly receiving SMS reminders compared to people only having a savings account (control group).
•	b3 = Possessing a savings account, watching a short educational video and receiving a notebook with financial rules of thumb compared to only having a savings account (control group).

Regarding the sampling strategies, the research team will chose around 25 BancoEstado branches to execute the intervention. They will be chosen following a socio-economic evaluation, focusing on those concentrating more vulnerable population. We will stratify the sample to randomly assign participants to treatment and control groups. The stratification variables are (1) saving goal and (2) reception of subsidies.

","","Given the experimental nature of the evaluation and implementation of the method, it’s impossible to randomize ex post the offer, at least for the treatments that include the automatic savings and the educational video (treatments 1 and 3). This is because the acceptance of an automatic savings mechanism requires the signing of consents and legal documents that can only be filled on the branch by a trained executive. Thus, the randomization will be performed at the branch by the device used to execute the survey, a tablet. This tablet will be specially programmed to carry out this work and stratify by type of saving goal and the receipt of state subsidies. ","As randomization instrument, the last digit of the National Identification Number will be used. This national identification number, assigned at birth, depends on the order of inscription and the National Register, and therefore is not related to any personal or socioeconomic variable.

This is particularly unfortunate in a low-income context where pregnancy among young girls can result in illegal and often dangerous abortions, the spread of HIV/AIDS and, more generally, poor health, educational, and economic outcomes.

The present study takes place in Tanzania and investigates the fertility and economic decisions of girls when they are on the verge of making two of the most important decisions in their lives: what to do when leaving school and whether to start childbearing. 

The present project investigates whether early childbearing reflects a lack of empowerment among young girls in Tanzania, with a focus on two different empowerment strategies. First, we offer an information treatment where young girls are targeted with detailed and extensive information about reproductive health, gender equality, and rights. Second, we offer an opportunity treatment where young girls are targeted with entrepreneurship training to improve their skills on how to run a business. Both treatments aim at empowering girls, but through different channels. The information treatment represents in many ways the classical approach in the field, where the underlying idea is that teenage pregnancies reflect lack of relevant information and personal control. The opportunity treatment, on the other hand, investigates whether teenage pregnancies to a large extent reflect a lack of economic opportunities. By comparing these two treatments, the study will provide novel insights on the relative importance of providing information and opportunities to adolescent girls, which is important both from a theoretical and a policy perspective. In addition, since there may be important complementarities in how the two treatments work, we also offer a cross-treatment to a subsample of the girls. 

An ultimate goal of this research project is to inform the design of sound policies, and we are thus particularly careful to develop a cost-effective intervention with scaling-up potential: all treatments are evaluated and compared not only in terms of impact but also on their relative economic costs. The interventions are based on current practices of our partners, which makes it easier to scale up the successful parts of the project and, more generally, to use the knowledge from the project to improve existing policies.


The main aim of the long-term follow-up is to study whether there are any behavioral and welfare changes due to the training programs, and whether the short term effects on gender equality attitudes and empowerment are persistent. 

The long-term follow-up survey was conducted as telephone interviews one year after the last training session. The survey also includes incentivized questions on patience.

Taking into account the effect of clustering and the fact that we have three different treatment groups in addition to a control group, we have with the planned sample a power of 80% (with a 5% confidence interval) to detect a decrease in pregnancy rate from 25% to 20% (using the approach of Hayes and Moulton, 2009).

These two marketing channels are radically different from the point of view of the farmers: small traders pay prices higher than the larger buyers and pay farmers in cash (rather than through consolidated transfers at the end of the month). We work in partnership with a large dairy cooperative in Kenya and propose a set of experiments to understand how interlinked transactions explain this prevailing market structure.

Using a comprehensive baseline survey, we hypothesize farmers face saving constraints and have a demand for deferred and bulky payments. Only large organizations, with enough reputation, can provide saving service through deferred payments. On the other hand, farmers do not trust small traders to hold their money. We propose several experiments to test this hypothesis.

We offer selected members of the coop the option to be paid more frequently than the coop currently does. In a first treatment, we ask farmers to chose whether they want to be paid daily for their milk deliveries to the coop - as opposed to continue being paid monthly as the coop currently does. We offer a price increase to those farmers that switch.

In a second treatment, we offer farmers the choice between continue being paid monthly versus having the flexibility to chose, every day, whether they prefer their deliveries to be paid in cash or at the end of the month. In both cases, we increase prices paid for a subset of their deliveries deliveries. 

In a third experiment in which farmers are assigned to a short-run bonus for a subset of their milk deliveries with either monthly or flexible payments (as in the second choice experiment described above) for short periods of three days each. 

Finally, we hypothesize that farmers adopt a rule of thumb rule where they use their morning milk for savings and their afternoon milk for liquidity and consumption. In order to test with hypothesis, we plan to elicit preferences for monthly vs. daily payments for morning and afternoon.

1. Take up of the daily (choice experiment 1) and flexible (choice experiment 2) mode of payment.

2. Afternoon milk deliveries to the coop (extensive and intensive margin). We will also look at morning deliveries to detect any substitution effect within day.

The experiment is incentivized: farmers become eligible to receive the daily payment in cash if and only if they select into it.  

CHOICE EXPERIMENT 2: 
Approx. 100 farmers currently delivering milk to the cooperative are asked to chose between two different modes of payment from the coop for milk deliveries during October: Monthly on an account (status quo) and Flexible Cash, in which farmers keep the choice, every day, whether they are paid cash or with a transfer on the account at the end of the month. Both options also yield an additional amount per litre for the first three litres delivered in the afternoon. The experiment is incentivized: farmers become eligible to receive the flexible payment in cash if and only if they select into it.

300 farmers receive the incentive experiment. According to a predetermined scheduled, farmers are contacted and offered one of two treatments.

This paper outlines the pre-analysis plan for a survey experiment conducted with citizens in Uganda that examine how citizens allocate blame and credit for the provision of public goods at the local level and how this affects electoral accountability.

PILOT N. 2

Respondents will be presented with two systems, A and B, varying in the way organs are procured and allocated to recipients, and in their efficiency, i.e. in the expected number of organs procured and thus in the percentage of patients who obtain an organ transplant.

There are three systems:

System A: unpaid donors, government agency recruits donors, allocation of organs based on priority rules based on urgency, waiting time, etc.

System B: $20,000 cash paid to donors, individual purchases or organs, market-based allocation of organs 

System C: $20,000 cash paid to donors through a government agency; allocation of organs based on priority rules based on urgency, waiting time, etc.

And five possible levels of “efficiency as follows:

	N organs procured	% of patients who obtain a transplant 
0	12000	10
1	30000	25
2	60000	50
3	90000	75
4	120000	100

Respondents are randomly assigned to one of twenty-six possible pairs of systems as follows:
A1B1, A1B0, A1C0, A1C1, A1B2, A1C2, A1B3, A1C3, A1B4, A1C4: Here we compare A1 (the actual level of efficiency of the current system) with all other system-efficiency possibilities). 
A2B2, A2B1, A2C1, A2C2, A2B3, A2C3, A2B4, A2C4: Here we do the same as above, but assuming that the unpaid donor system has higher efficiency (A2). The trade-offs could be different if the unpaid donor system was more efficient.
B4C4, B3C3, B4C3, B3C4, B4C2, B3C2, B4C1, B3C1: Here we compare the free market and the regulated market systems. We do so assuming high levels of efficiency (3 or 4) for the free market. The goal is to see whether people are willing to choose the free market when it helps more patients than the regulated market.

The structure of the survey is as follows:

a.	Respondents are shown a screen with two systems (26 possible pairs randomly assigned; see below) 
b.	For each system, respondents are asked to give their morality judgments
c.	Choice: respondents are asked to choose which of the two systems they would prefer
d.	Overall rating: respondents are asked to rate each system from 0-100
e.	Elicitation of minimum efficiency required to switch to the other system
f.	Demographics

We implement a natural field experiment to measure the welfare effects of one especially policy-relevant intervention, home energy conservation reports. We measure consumer surplus by sending consumers introductory reports and using an incentive compatible multiple price list survey to elicit willingness-to-pay to continue the program. The experimental design also allows us to estimate negative willingness-to-pay and address non-response bias. The results underscore that the welfare effects of non-price ""nudge"" interventions can be measured, and policy makers should strongly consider the welfare effects of such interventions, not just their effects on behavior.",2015-03-30,2015-06-01,The outcome of interest is the WTP for home energy reports,"","We implemented our study with a medium-sized utility company (“the Utility”) in the north- eastern United States and a third-party contractor (the “Implementer”) that implements standard home energy reports. During the winter of 2015, the Implementer mailed four home energy reports on an opt-out basis to 10,000 randomly-selected Utility residential natural gas consumers. The Utility plans to continue these same customers on a home energy report program in winter 2016. In the same envelope as the final report of 2015, we included an incentive-compatible multiple price list (MPL) survey that allows us to measure each household’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the next winter of home energy reports and construct a demand curve for continued reports.

Aside from simply measuring the demand curve, our design also involved several useful features. First, out MPL questions were structured such that they allow recipients to reveal positive or negative WTP. This is important because a small number of consumers opt out of home energy reports, implying that they dislike them enough to bear the time costs of opting out. Second, to test the channels through which the reports might affect willingness-to-pay, we randomly assigned households to three different survey versions. One cued the reports’ social comparison feature, the second cued the environmental benefits of energy conservation, and the the third was a control.

Third, we carefully designed the survey to be able to address non-response. This is important because the intervention is delivered on an opt-out basis, meaning that we are interested in welfare effects across the entire 10,000-household population receiving the reports, but many recipients will not respond to our MPL survey. The direction and magnitude of non-response bias is an empirical question: non-responders might be more likely to have zero or negative WTP (this is very likely the case for people who do not open the home energy reports and thus never see the survey), but some might have positive WTP but a high cost of time for survey response. To address this, we carried out “intensive follow-up” (DiNardo, McCrary, and Sanbonmatsu 2006) by re-surveying a randomly-selected 2/3 of the original survey population. Comparing average WTP in the base and intensive follow-up groups suggests the direction of non-response bias, and the ratio of the WTP difference to the change in response rates suggests the magnitude. Thus, we can evaluate welfare effects within the sample of respondents and extrapolate (under functional form assumptions) to the entire treated population.

With the basic empirical results in hand, we can carry out a full welfare evaluation of continuing the home energy report program. The welfare effects of continuing the program are the sum of effects on consumer welfare (the area under the demand curve), minus the cost of mailing the reports, plus the reduction in uninternalized energy use externalities. We compare this to the more traditional cost effectiveness metric, which compares the program implementation cost to the social cost of energy. By ignoring consumer welfare effects, the traditional metric could generate very different results.

One potential criticism of our approach might be that it “takes revealed preference too seriously”: if one motivation for the program is that consumers are poorly informed about energy use, why should we assume that their valuations are well-informed? Conceptually, it is important to re- member that WTP is assessed after recipients are experienced with the intervention, so they should be capable of valuing it. Our empirical data also allow us to provide additional evidence. One specific concern might be that consumers know the costs they incur in conserving energy, but they do not know the benefits because it is difficult to infer financial gains of particular energy conservation actions. (“How much did we save last month because we turned the lights off more?”) To test this, we elicit beliefs over the average energy cost savings induced by the intervention and compare that to the true empirical estimates. A second and more conceptually challenging concern is that consumers might tend to be optimistically biased about their energy use compared to neighbors, and willingness to pay is low because the intervention reveals the truth. As in Brunnermeier and Parker (2005) and Oster, Shoulson, and Dorsey (2013), there is then some question about whether welfare analysis should respect or ignore a reduction in consumer surplus from eliminating optimism bias. To calibrate robustness checks in the welfare analysis, we ask report recipients whether they were initially positively or negatively surprised by the social comparison information, and we can adjust welfare estimates to account for correlation between low WTP and initial overoptimism.","",The utility provided the PIs with a list of accounts and the randomization was made in an office by a computer. ,The randomization unit is the household ,The treatment will not be clustered.,"20,000 households","10,000 treated households, randomized into 3 groups.

In order to test the impact of the interventions, a sample of participants from Kibera, a large slum in Nairobi, were randomly selected into two treatment groups and one control group. All groups were subjected to personality tests and information was also collated on various demographic attributes prior to the treatments to allow determination of the causal effect of each treatment. At the end of the session respondents were all offered the option to purchase a cook stove in a lottery setting designed to establish the willingness to pay for a cook stove for each respondent. The two treatment groups were designed to test the impact of scarcity and as- pirations on the cook stove purchase decision. The control group received market- ing information about the benefits of improved cookstoves. The second and third treatment groups received the same marketing information in addition to another treatment. The second treatment group followed the format of the control except that participants were told that the number of cookstoves available for purchase was limited in order to generate a feeling of scarcity. The third treatment group received ‘aspirational’ thinking priming. Respondents were induced into an ‘aspirational mind-set’ through the use of spoken narratives. Further to testing the impact of the abovementioned interventions, the study also aims to test the impact of scarcity on participation rates in a health related information session.

What is the impact of aspirational priming on cook stove purchasing?","","Respondents were selected to take part in the study attended sessions at the computer based testing centre at the Busara Center for Behavioural Economics in Nairobi between April and May 2015. All information was administered via com- puter screens whilst an enumerator assisted respondents through the various stages of the treatment. All respondents took part in an initial data collection phase of the study. This initial phase involved a time-preference test, which gauged the appetite of the respondent to choose smaller amounts of money at a certain date, compared to a larger amount of money at a later date. Respondents were also subject to a Raven’s Test to measure cognitive ability, a number of demographic questions, and a personality test based off the Big Five personality traits.
Data from this phase of the study was designed for two main purposes. First, it will allow detection of correlations between personal traits and energy-saving household items. By carefully measuring personality and economic preference, it will be possible to determine if people with certain traits are highly correlated with both ownership and interest in energy-saving appliances. Second, the data will assist with the analysing of heterogeneous effects of priming on purchasing decisions. This will make it possible to identify how the treatments affect people of different types. After completion of the initial phase of the study respondents allocated to treatment groups then received the treatments specific to their groups.
After the treatments were administered, respondents revealed their willingness to purchase a cook stove via a lottery opportunity. Participants in all treatment groups were read marketing information on the cook stove available in the lottery. The cookstove was also held up so that respondents could view the item. Respondents were then asked to input a price that they were willing to pay for the item and told that a random lottery would dictate whether or not they would have the opportunity to buy the item. The respondent was told that in the case that their stated willingness to pay was higher than the price they would have to purchase the item.

Despite its origins as a way of cultivating clarity of thought, among the collection of studies on mindfulness conducted in recent years few studies have been concerned with the link between mindfulness and thinking skills in typically developing individuals. Assessments that attempt to capture the thinking skills of people in real-world situations can be found in the body of literature focused on critical thinking (CT; Butler, 2012; Ku, 2009). CT is recognised as an important higher-order cognitive process which involves the ability to analyse and evaluate evidence and arguments without bias from experience and prior knowledge. The application of CT requires a non-automatic response to a problem situation in order to avoid heuristic and biased thinking (West, Toplak, & Stanovich, 2008). Such non-automatic, critical and reflective responses are generally regarded as involving deliberative processes, referred to as Type 2 processes by Dual-Processing theorists (Evans & Stanovich, 2013) and require the engagement of executive functioning i.e. inhibiting, updating, and switching between representations in working memory.  While an emerging body of theoretical and empirical work has linked mindfulness with enhanced executive functioning (Chambers, Lo, & Allen, 2007; Josefsson & Broberg, 2011; Tang, Yang, Leve, & Harold, 2012; Teper & Inzlicht, 2013), little is known about the relationship between executive functioning and critical thinking (Sanz de Acedo Lizarraga, Sanz de Acedo Baquedano, & Villanueva, 2012). Furthermore, though mindfulness has been shown to facilitate certain types of higher-order cognition, including insight problem-solving (Ostafin & Kassman, 2012; Wen, Butler, & Koutstaal, 2013), moral reasoning and ethical decision-making (Cottone & Javier, 2007; Ruedy & Schweitzer, 2011; Shapiro, Jazaieri, & Goldin, 2012), the relationship between mindfulness and critical thinking has not been empirically investigated. 
In light of these identified gaps in the literature and building on two previous studies carried out as part of the principal applicant’s PhD which suggested links between trait and state mindfulness, executive functioning and critical thinking, the current project seeks to investigate the relationship between regular mindfulness practice, executive functioning, and critical thinking skills and dispositions in the context of a randomized-controlled intervention delivered online using the Headspace app.

","","Sampling Frame
This study took place in the catchment area of banks in three market centers in Western Kenya. A census of all households in these catchment areas was carried out between August and September 2009. The census survey collected information on demographic characteristics of the household, sources of income, as well as access to financial services, knowledge and perceptions of available financial services, and saving practices. A total of 1,898 households were surveyed during the census exercise. Only 20% of these households had a member with a bank account, despite the fact that the average distance to the closest deposit-taking financial institution was (by design) only 1.6 kilometers, suggesting that physical access was unlikely to be a limiting factor. Account ownership was predominantly male: 21% of men had a bank account, against only 10% of women.

Of the 1,898 households in the census, about half (989) were selected to participate in the study. Those households excluded from the study were those with at least one bank account holder (20%), and relatively atypical households, i.e. polygamous households (8%) and households with no female head (11%). Of the 989 sampled households, we could survey both (when applicable) households heads in survey round 1 in 931 cases, and again in at least one of the following rounds in 885 of the cases. Our analysis sample thus consists of 885 households for whom we have at least one follow-up survey round.

Randomization
Out of the household sample, we created a sample of household heads. This individual-level sample included either one or two individuals per household: the female head for single female-headed households, and both the female and male head for dual-headed households. We then randomized these individuals into treatment and control groups. The randomization was done in May 2010, after stratifying the sample by household composition (single female-headed or dual-headed), primary occupation, and market center. Note that the randomization was conducted at the individual, not the household level. Thus, among dual-headed households, while there are households in which either, both, or neither spouse got the account, the size of each group was determined by chance -- and consequently, the four groups are not equal sized. Table A1 shows the final breakdown of households in our analysis sample. Among dual-headed households, 17% had no one assigned to the treatment, 33% had both heads assigned to the treatment group, 26% had only the female head assigned to treatment and 24% had only the male head assigned to treatment. Among single female-headed households, 50% were assigned to the treatment group.

Savings accounts
Individuals selected for the treatment received a nominal, non-transferable voucher for a free savings account. As mentioned above, the study took place around three market centers. In one of these market centers, both the Village Bank and the Commercial Bank have a branch, and the voucher was redeemable at either bank. In the other two market centers, only the Village Bank had a branch, so respondents in those markets were given a voucher redeemable only at the Village Bank. The experiment waived all account opening and maintenance fees, but did not cover any withdrawal fees. In total, the subsidy amounted to $5 for accounts at the village bank and $2.50 plus $0.60 a month for maintenance at the commercial bank. The commercial bank account came with a free ATM card. 

The vouchers were delivered to people in their homes between late May and early July 2010. During that visit, individuals received information on how the banks and accounts worked, and when and how to redeem the voucher. Upon opening the account, individuals could choose to open the account jointly with their spouse or alone. Sixty-nine percent of vouchers that were distributed were redeemed. Only 5.7% of accounts that were opened were joint accounts.","","Randomization was done in office by computer, using Stata.","Randomization was done at the individual level, but most of the analysis was performed at the household level.

One Step at a Time:   Does Gradualism Build Coordination?,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/929,"October 28, 2015",2015-10-28 21:11:46 -0400,AEARCTR-0000929,"Plamen Nikolov, pnikolov@post.harvard.edu",on_going,2010-07-01,2018-07-01,"[""finance"", ""governance"", """"]",C91; C92; D03; D71; D81; H41,"This study investigates a potential mechanism to promote coordination. With theoretical guidance using a belief-based learning model with level-k thinking, we conduct a multiple-period, binary-choice, and weakest-link coordination experiment in the laboratory to study the effect of gradualism – increasing the required levels (“stakes”) of contributions slowly over time rather than requiring a high level of contribution immediately – on group coordination performances in high-stake projects. We randomly assign subjects to three treatments: starting and continuing at a high stake, starting at a low stake but jumping to a high stake after a few periods, as well as starting at a low stake and gradually increasing the stakes over time (the Gradualism treatment). We find that groups coordinate most successfully with high stakes in the Gradualism treatment relative to the other two treatments. We also find evidence that supports the belief-based learning model. These findings point to a simple mechanism for promoting successful voluntary coordination when other mechanisms, such as communication and information feedback, are absent or limited. ",2010-07-01,2018-07-01,"We focus our analysis on the following three outcome variables per period: (1) whether a group coordinates successfully (defined as whether all four group members contribute) or not, (2) whether an individual contributes or not, and (3) payoff of each individual.","","      The experiment consists of 18 sessions, which are computerized using the z-Tree software package (Fischbacher, 2007). Both the instructions and the game information shown on the computer screen are in Chinese. In each session, we randomly assign subjects to groups of four; our sample consist of 64 groups in total. 

      The experiment includes two stages: The first stage comprises twelve periods, whereas the second one comprises eight periods. Group members do not change within each stage but subjects are randomly reshuffled into groups of four after the first stage; this rule is made to be common information. The subjects are not told the exact number of periods in each stage. Instead, the subjects are told that the experiment would last from 30 minutes to one hour, including the time for sign-up, reading of instructions, taking a quiz designed to ensure that subjects understand the experimental rule, and final payment. We note two features of this design. First, we want to reduce the possibility of backward induction.  Second, our study design approximates features of real-world situations. In many real-world cases, people do not know the exact number of coordination opportunities. 

      At the beginning of each period, subjects know the stake of the current period but not those of future periods. This condition replicates the circumstances of many real-world cases, in which people do not know what is at stake in future interactions.  

      In each period, we endow each subject with 20 points and ask each to give a certain number of points to the common pool of his/her assigned group. The required number could vary across periods, and each subject could only choose either “to give the exact points required” (we use the natural term “give” rather than “contribute” in the instruction), which we refer to as stake, or “not to give” at all. If all members in a group contribute, then each member not only receives the stake back, but also gains an extra return, which equals the stake. If not all group members contribute, then each member finishes the period with only his/her remaining points (i.e., the initial endowment in each period minus the contribution of the subject).  

      At the end of each period, each subject knows whether all four group members (including himself/herself) contributed the stake for that period but did not know the total number of group members who contributed (in case fewer than four members contributed). This design is consistent with the standard design in the literature of minimum-effort coordination games (e.g., Van Huyck et al., 1990), in which the only commonly available historical data to players is the minimum contribution of group members. By adopting this design we can also increase the difficulty of coordination given other aspects of the experiment, and study whether gradualism can help overcome such a difficulty.
       
       The final total payment to each player equals the accumulated earnings over all periods plus a show-up fee. The exchange rate is 40 points per CNY 1. An average subject earned CNY 21–22 (around USD 3) including the show-up fee for the whole experiment, which covers ordinary meals for one to two days on campus. With regard to the purchasing power, this payment is comparable to those experiments conducted in other countries. 

       Our experiment comprises four treatments: (1) Big Bang, (2) Semi-Gradualism, (3) Gradualism, and (4) a variant of the Big Bang treatment, which we call the High Show-up Fee treatment. All groups in the three main treatments face the same stake in the second half (Periods 7–12) of the first stage, but stake paths differ for each treatment in the first half (Periods 1–6). The first half of the first stage feature different stake paths for each treatment. The different stake paths might yield potential earning differences and could potentially lead to a wealth effect across treatments. To isolate the wealth effect on the contribution of participants from the effect of the three main treatments in the second half of the first stage, we introduce the High Show-up Fee treatment, which is a variant of the Big Bang treatment. We randomly assign 12 subjects into the three main treatments for 8 of the 18 sessions. In the remaining 10 sessions, we randomly assign 16 subjects into the four treatments (three main treatments and one supplementary High Show-up Fee treatment). In total, we have 18, 18, 18, and 10 groups in Big Bang, Semi-Gradualism, Gradualism, and High Show-up Fee treatments, respectively.

This program currently serves more than 150,000 students annually, but to date its effectiveness is unknown. 

The impact evaluation of the DOLE Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES), is a partnership between DOLE, 3ie and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), aiming to design, implement and evaluate the impact of SPES on academic outcomes, youth employability and labor market perceptions. The evaluation is conducted Leigh Linden (University of Texas at Austin), Emily Beam (National University of Singapore), Stella Quimbo (University of the Philippines) and Nathanael Goldberg (Innovations for Poverty Action), with the coordination of IPA Philippines.

We propose a large-scale randomized field experiment to assess the effectiveness of SPES. Specifically, we suggest using an oversubscription randomized control trial. With our help, SPES will conduct a large outreach effort to recruit more applicants than available positions in the program. From the pool of applicants, we will then randomly choose individuals to fill the available slots. We will compare the future behavior of applicants in the medium-term (12 months later) by comparing those chosen for the program to those who were not. 
The primary focus of the evaluation will be to assess the effects of SPES on students’ school participation and labor market outcomes. School participation will include whether students are enrolled and obtain passing grades. Labor market outcomes will include income, work hours, and job-search effort and duration.

Finally to provide guidance on the best strategies for matching applicants with positions, we plan to assess how the type of work experience students obtain affects their later enrollment decisions and employment outcomes. Work experience specific to students’ experience and interests may lead to greater program take-up and retention, larger impacts on school enrollment, and a faster transition to employment upon exiting school. Alternatively, the combination of earnings with general work experience, regardless of the nature of the work, may be the main determinant of students’ outcomes. This may be particularly true if exposing students to different work areas provides them with information and exposure to new career opportunities. ",2016-04-01,2016-06-30,"The primary focus of the evaluation will be to assess the effects of SPES on students’ school participation and labor market outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest include the following:
• Education: share of applicants enrolled in school, share graduated (from high school and from college), share dropout, grade repetition, time to degree, and grades (general weighted average). 
• Employment: share employed, share employed in formal sector, share employed in “vulnerable employment” (self-employed or unpaid family businesses), share currently looking for work, and duration of job search. 
The secondary outcomes of interest include the impact of SPES on students’ incomes and expenditures, on students’ earnings in the short and medium run, and on education spending. We will also measure the impact of SPES on employability, as assessed by subjective measures of individuals’ self-empowerment, self-esteem, aspirations, and labor market perceptions:
• Income: SPES earnings, self-reported individual income. 
• Consumption: Education spending, non-education spending.
• Employability: Index measures of self-empowerment and self-esteem, aspirations, labor market perceptions.

","We will conduct an oversubscription randomized field experiment to identify the causal impact of the SPES program. Eligible applicants will be randomized into a treatment group invited to enroll in the program and a control group. This initial lottery will exempt a small number of applicants who have previously participated in SPES. For all applicants, including those exempt from the initial lottery, we will work with the implementing partners to randomly assign accepted applicants to available jobs, subject to applicants meeting any job requirements set for each position. Those in the control group will be prohibited from joining SPES for one year. We will then randomly select a subset of control and treatment group students to be a part of our study, aiming for equal division on average between treatment and control groups to maximize power. Based on power calculations, 4,000 will be assigned to control and 4,000 to treatment. The exact treatment-to-control ratios and the ratio of sample size to number of applicants will vary at the municipal level because the oversubscription rate will also vary. Screening more applicants than we include in the study will enable us to be flexible to variations in the oversubscription rate and to maximize cost efficiency by having equally sized treatment and control groups.","",Public lottery,Individual,"8,000 applicants (no clusters)","8,000 applicants","4,000 applicants control, 4,000 applicants treatment","We propose a set of power calculations based on rough assumptions about the school enrollment rate and distribution of students across grade levels.

In fact, teaching the youth how to design and implement a viable project can help them become more autonomous, improve their self-confidence and teach them to make informed and independent decisions.

Field visits have been organized by the evaluation team to check the compliance with the protocol.

The entry of young volunteers in the experiment was performed in two steps. Following an initial contact with the young (through an individual or collective session), the youth adviser presents the detailed content of the program to the young and check their eligibility. After that, the principle of randomization was exposed by the advisers to the young who also gave them the text of the informed consent. Youth advisers have been widely informed about the methodology used in this trial and session pooling practices were organised to train them to face the potential questions about the selection process.

The study (World Bank Project P145184) takes place in the context of the World Bank and Nordic Development Fund-assisted Stormwater Management and Climate Change Adaptation Project (PROGEP; World Bank Project P122841), implemented by the Dakar Municipal Development Agency. The major investment under PROGEP is the construction of new and the rehabilitation of existing drainage infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Such investments, however, suffer from the tragedy of the commons – individuals have the incentive to abuse shared resources as they personally incur the benefits while the costs are shared by the whole community. In particular, in PROGEP areas public spaces are used to dispose of waste, clogging storm-water drainage systems and reducing their effectiveness, sustainability, and the returns on this major investment. There is a lack of knowledge on the negative effects of poor waste management and a lack of accountability to discourage adverse behavior. Currently, there is little evidence on how best to engage communities in the preservation of public spaces and infrastructures, particularly in urban settings, and this study will experimentally test “Operation Quartier Propre” (Operation Clean Neighborhood), a new intervention where local community-based organizations are charged with the cleanliness of their neighborhood, are provided with an initial in-kind endowment to support them in this task, and are eligible for non-monetary incentives based on an external assessment of their respective community’s cleanliness.

This study will examine several factors which may influence decision making of policymakers in order to determine now real-life decision makers consider various forms of information. Although decisions regarding the allocation of aid are complex and require decision-makers to analyze a large amount of information regarding which populations are in need, and where previous aid has been provided, the availability of information does not guarantee its use in policy decisions. Indeed, many studies have identified a gap between the belief of social scientists that the information they produce should be used to inform policymaking and the real life behavior of individual policy-makers. Thus, this study will examine how a sample of real-world policy makers use informational input to inform their decision making process in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

The experiment will follow a 4 (Information type: Control, Placebo, Need, Aid) x 2 (Transparency: Private vs. Transparent decisions).

Information type will be manipulated by providing subjects with maps depicting different types of information about the regions to which aid they can allocate aid (described in further detail below). After viewing maps in each condition, will decide how much of a hypothetical US $30 million allocation to distribute to each of ten districts presented. Participants will be informed that they will be paid for their participation in the study, and will be able to donate all or some of their payment based on the actual proportion they decided to contribute in one of the conditions (randomly chosen at the end of the study). 

In the first part of the study (the private decision treatment) all participants will first complete a control condition. This condition will serve as a baseline to examine the impact of the other treatment conditions. In the control condition, the map shown to participants will not contain any information, and will simply depict the ten regions to which aid can be allocated. 

After the control condition, participants will then complete the aid allocations under three additional information treatments: Aid, Need, and Placebo. In the Aid condition, participants will be shown maps indicating how much Aid funding had been provided to each of the ten districts by the Prime Minister’s relief. In the Need condition, participants will be shown maps indicating the total value of disaster effects for each of the ten districts. Finally, in the Placebo condition, participants will be shown maps with information irrelevant to aid allocations, in this case, the percentage of children receiving recommended vaccinations in each district. These three conditions will be presented in random order following the control condition.

The second part of the study consists of a ‘transparency’ treatment. In this part of the study, participants will be informed that their names and decisions will be made public in the final report of the study, without any other demographic or survey response information. Only the decisions of the participants in the ‘transparency’ condition will have identifying information (specifically, the participant’s name and the districts they contributed aid resources to), and this will only be done with the full consent of the participant. Participants will opt into the second part of the study, and informed consent will be separately obtained from participants. In this condition, participants will complete aid allocations for each of the above conditions (Control, Aid, Need, Placebo) under conditions of transparency. As in the non-transparency condition, participants will first complete the control condition, and then the following three conditions will be presented in random order. Participants who choose not to opt into the transparency condition for any reason will also complete these four conditions, but will be asked to make their decisions imagining that their decisions would be made public. 

After all allocation tasks have been completed, participants will be given their payment (Rs. 3000), and will have the opportunity to donate all or portion of their payment, in increments of Rs. 300. This donation will be split amongst the districts according to percentages from the one of the eight allocation tasks participants, randomly chosen. The donated amount will be provided to the regions via partner aid organizations. 

Prior to and following the eight allocation decision tasks, participants will fill out brief questionnaires. Prior to beginning the study participants will answer questions regarding the organization which they are employed at, as well a several questions assessing how much they were affected by the 2015 earthquake. The pre-experiment survey will also assess participants’ attitudes toward the Government of Nepal, International Aid Agencies, and Civil Society. Next, the participants will be asked to indicate whether they have visited each district to be included as an allocation target, and rank each district according to how much they think each district was impacted by the disaster and how much aid they think each district received. Following the allocations decision tasks, participants will fill out a separate short survey assessing attitudes regarding transparency, and beliefs about the level of transparency in the international aid agencies, the Nepal government, and civil society. They will also fill out a short scale asking participants to rate factors (i.e., concern for reputation, responsibility felt toward affiliated districts, the extent to which they considered data provided in the maps, trust in the map information, and strategic concerns) they considered while making allocation decisions.

This is the most appropriate approach to randomisation given the intervention will be focused on teacher professional learning and the implementation of that knowledge within a whole-of-classroom approach. It will also limit the potential for contamination by separating the trial arms at the school level.

An effect sizes of 0.3 SDs can be meaningful at a population level given the reach. In this trial in particular it is an approximate 6 month difference in progress and would represent a “clinically” significant difference in outcomes. 

Randomisation of 561 children per arm is required to provide 90% power to detect a minimum difference of 0.3 standard deviations on the NAPLAN ‘Reading’ scores at grade 3, allowing for an average intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.08 and an average cluster size of 17. To allow for a potential attrition rate of 20% of children by the time children are in grade 3, 700 children per arm (1400 in total) will be required in the study.

We show theoretically that if students are concerned about appearing ""smart"" in front of their peers, or if students care about appearing ""cool""/social, the result might be a lower level of schooling effort when compared to a situation where these concerns do not exist. 

We designed a simple field experiment, in the spirit of the one used by Bursztyn and Jensen (2015) to identify the importance of these two mechanisms. We plan to visit high schools in the LA area, targeting 11th grade classrooms. Students will be offered the chance to sign up for a lottery to access a free online SAT prep package. We will randomly vary at the student level:

1) whether students believe their decision to sign up and the score of an individual diagnostic test score will be observed by their classmates;
2) the probability (25% vs 75%) that students gain access to the package conditional on signing up for the lottery.

Our hypotheses are:

1) ""public"" sign up rates should be lower than ""private"" sign up rates;
2) changes in the probability of winning of lottery should have a small or null effect on the ""private"" sign up rates;
3) changes in the probability of winning of lottery are expected to have an effect on the ""public"" sign up rates:
a) in settings where trying to appear cool/social is the predominant mechanism, a higher probability should lead to a higher sign up rate;
b) in settings where trying to appear smart is the predominant mechanism, a higher probability should lead to a lower increase in the sign up rate and potentially even a negative effect on the sign up rate.

We will visit schools where we expect different mechanisms to be dominant:
1) schools in low-income areas: we expect ""signaling that one is cool"" to be the dominant mechanism;
2) schools in middle or higher income areas: we expect """"signaling that one is smart"" to be the dominant mechanism.

Part of the problem is that many poor children are neither prepared for nor receive support with schoolwork, and initial gaps in performance are reinforced by a tendency for teachers to focus on “high – performers.”  There is very little evidence of effective school-readiness curricula for poor children to combat this issue. If effective curricula could be devised, the achievement gap in mathematics between rich and poor children could be dramatically reduced as learning school mathematics depends on the exercise of numerical and geometric concepts that emerge in infancy and that are equally accessible to children of all cultures (Dehaene et al., 2006) across the socioeconomic spectrum (Gilmore et al., 2010). These early-developing mathematical concepts are greatly enhanced by exercise, which leads to measurable gains in school math performance (Griffin & Case, 1997). 

This project aims to develop and evaluate a game-based preschool curriculum to enhance children's: (1) core numerical and geometric abilities in relation to the symbol systems of elementary school mathematics; (2) awareness of their own mathematical abilities and of the growth of those abilities with exercise; (3) appreciation of the link between everyday cognition and school-based skills. The ultimate goal is to prepare disadvantaged children – cognitively and motivationally – for success in school.

We will evaluate the games together as a curriculum, by introducing them to children in Indian preschools in the framework of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to  assess whether the group of games together produces changes in children's mathematical competence or motivation both at the end of preschool and for at least one year later. 

To asses the effect of the mathematical games themselves, in contrast to simply playing games in school, we will be introducing ""social games"", which could develop skills that are also by-product of the math games (attention to rules, ability to stay on task, etc) without a focus on mathematics. There are thus 3 groups: control, social games, and math games.

(3) In the third group (social games), a trained assistant will implement “social games.” Six social games, each equivalent in gameplay and teacher/peer engagement to one math game but lacking in numerical or geometric content, will be introduced to classrooms following the same schedule as the math games. Social games aim to enhance children's pedagogical learning by training basic communicative skills such as evaluating emotions on a face or determining the object of a person's attention. This condition will allow us to distinguish the impact of structured play from the focus on non-symbolic mathematics per se.

The program, which includes the direct transfer of productive assets (e.g. livestock) and additional training, was initially developed in Bangladesh, where it has reached thousands of beneficiaries, and is being piloted and studied in over seven countries. The results of this study, based on a pilot in India, indicate that this intervention succeeds in elevating the economic situation of the poorest. We find that the program results in a 15% increase in household consumption and has positive impacts on other measures of household wealth and welfare, such as assets and emotional well-being. Our results are consistent with the notion that the wealth transfer, in the form of asset distribution, directly increased consumption among beneficiary households through the liquidation of assets, but other sources of income, notably from small enterprises, appear to have contributed to the overall increase in consumption as well.",2007-02-01,2011-11-30,"Key outcomes include income, consumption, assets, nutrition, health, food security, financial behaviors, and labor supply.","","We collected data for the study in two waves of surveying.

The survey consisted of a household module covering income, consumption, and various other features of the household, as well as an adult module capturing information on labor supply, time use, and health.  

Following completion of the baseline survey, households were randomly selected to participate in Bandhan's THP program.  The program, consisting of direct asset transfers (mostly livestock), inoculation of savings habits and integration into microfinance groups, is designed to overcome barriers to upward mobility. The training component is intended to address the assumption that the poor either lack the confidence to escape poverty or that they lack sufficient human capital to make optimal use of assets. Regular meetings which provide both encouragement and training related to enterprise development are also part of the program.  

Randomization was done remotely by the research team and selection was stratified on hamlet.  A total of 991 households were surveyed at baseline, of which 512 were randomly selected for program participation. Households were re-surveyed in a first endline (18 months after the asset transfer) and a second endline (30 months after the asset transfer).

This study uses an experimental design to assess the biases of different methods of surveying people about their cheating behavior.",2015-08-14,2015-08-28,"Fraction of subjects who truthfully report having cheated is the main outcome variable.

Secondary outcome variables include responses to the set of questions included at the end of the survey about corruption, bribery, and expectations.","The average treatment effect of interest is the difference between the aggregate response bias in two experimental conditions.

The fraction of subjects who actually cheat in an experimental condition is the difference between the theoretical distribution of the outcome of the draw, and the self-reported distribution in that experimental condition. (Randomization implies that this should be roughly equal across experimental conditions).

The aggregate response bias in an experimental condition is the difference between the fraction who admit to having cheated, and the fraction of subjects who actually cheated.

These variables are described more precisely in the attached PDF document.

 ",The experimental design is described in the hidden part of the registration for this study.,"In this study I propose an experimental design to measure the causal effect of different survey question techniques on reporting bias for a sensitive question concerning cheating. This research design makes it possible to estimate the true aggregate level of cheating – the key quantity that has remained elusive in most previous studies. In the core part of the study, subjects are privately exposed to a draw from a known distribution and they are remunerated in proportion to the value of the draw that they report having obtained (thereby providing an incentive to exaggerate). They are then asked whether they reported their draw accurately or exaggerated. In each experimental condition, subjects are asked this question using a different survey technique: direct questioning, indirect questioning, RRT, and ICT. This makes it possible to estimate the average causal effect of each survey technique on response bias by comparing self-reported cheating with directly-estimated cheating, for each of the experimental conditions.

Laboratory experiments are often criticized on the grounds that experimenter demand effects (EDE) could distort subject behavior. Even when EDE distorts behavior, this provides cause for concern only when the distortion could in principle spuriously produce the key results -- distortions orthogonal to the behavior of interest could be safely ignored (Zizzo 2010). There is good reason to expect that EDE are not a cause of concern in the present study. First, it is possible that EDE could influence incentives to cheat (i.e., to misreport one's draw in order to receive a higher payment). However, the rate of cheating is not the estimand of interest. Moreover, any such distortion would be identical in all the experimental conditions. Second, it is not easy to see how EDE might distort the estimand of interest -- i.e., the difference in the average proportion who report having cheated and the estimated rate of cheating, in each experimental condition. One would have to argue, among other things, that different modes of asking (each associated with an experimental condition) are subject to different degrees of EDE. While I see no evident manner in which this might be the case, I nevertheless take several measures to mitigate potential EDE.

First, non-deceptive obfuscation is implemented by adding a filler section. The filler section makes it very difficult for the subject to figure out exactly what the researcher is after, since both the filler and core sections are plausibly of interest in the context of the study. Second, non-deceptive obfuscation is utilized within the core section of the study, in order to further decrease the possibility that subjects could figure out what the experimenter is after (or even what the central topic of the study is). Third, incentivized questions are utilized in both the core and the filler sections of the study, so that differences in incentives are not a clear indicator of researcher interest. Finally, to avoid EDE stemming from the physical presence of a researcher in the room (e.g., via eye contact, or tone of voice), the study is conducted entirely online.

More concretely, the first section of the study will focus on the use of small change -- a topic of salient historical and contemporary relevance due a traditional scarcity of small-denomination currency in Mexico. This section includes an incentivized question with the structure of a “beauty contest” (asking subjects which coin denomination they believe is most frequent among participants in the study). The second section will ask the subject to toss a coin several times and report the number of heads, providing incentives for subjects to exaggerate. The subject will then be asked whether she misreported. The manner of asking is the treatment variable, and it will vary across the experimental conditions. The four conditions are: direct questioning, indirect questioning, ICT, and RRT. This is the core section. The filler section provides a plausible alternative reason for asking subjects to have a coin at hand. The core section will additionally contain filler material emphasizing the topic of informal decision-making devices (such as the coin-toss or rock-paper-scissors), to provide a plausible alternative reason for asking subjects to toss the coin.

I expect to have 200-300 subjects total.,Design is not clustered; see above.,"Treatment conditions 1, 2 and 4 each have a 24% probability of arising; treatment condition 3 has a 28% probability.","Since this pre-registration text precedes the running of the pilot and of the full study, I rely on the literature to obtain a rough sense of the adequate sample size. I focus mainly on treatment effects taking direct questioning (condition 1) as the control condition, and each of the other three conditions as separate treatments. I focus on two studies where the sensitive item concerns some form of cheating, and on a general meta-analysis: 

• Ocantos et al (2012) study vote buying using the ICT. They find that only 2.4% (s.e.=0.6%) of subjects reported receiving an individual gift in echange for their vote during a 2008 election in Nicaragua when asked directly, but 24% (s.e.=5.5%) reported having received such a gift when asked through the ICT. Assuming equal variances for the treatment and control groups, and supposing the variance is numerically equal to that estimated for the treatment group (a conservative choice in this case), power is close to 1.0 even for a sample size as small as 30 (since the effect size is so large).

(Note: the formula I'm using, in Latex code, is: \beta=\Phi(\left[|\mu_{t}-\mu_{c}|\sqrt{N}\right]/2\sigma-\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha/2)), where \beta denotes power, \Phi is the cumulative Normal distribution, \Phi^{-1} is the inverse of such distribution, \sigma is the standard deviation of the outcome for both the treatment and the control groups, N is the sample size, and \alpha is the level of statistical significance (Gerber and Green 2012)).

• Van der Heijden et al (2000) compare RRT with direct questioning in both a face-to-face survey and a computer-assisted survey. The proportion of subjects known to have engaged in income fraud who admitted to it was 43% (s.e.=6.8%), 25%(s.e.=4.4%), and 19%(5.8%) respectively for RRT, face-to-face direct questioning, and computer direct questioning. The effect size here is also so large that even 30 subjects suffices to attain power close to 1.0 (assuming, for example, that the standard error of the outcomes is 6.8%, and choosing 43%-25%=18% as the magnitude of the treatment effect).

• In a meta-analysis of RRT, Lensvelt-Mulders (2005) find that the mean percent underestimation of a sensitive item using RRT is 38% (s.e.=.099), while it is 42% (s.e.=.099) in face-to-face interviews, 46% (s.e.=.138) in phone interviews, 47% (s.e.=.14) in self-administered questionnaires, and 62% (s.e.=.191) in computer-assisted surveys. Comparing the rate of reporting of the sensitive behavior under RRT with that under self-administered questionnaires, and taking the standard error to be 0.14, a sample size of 75 is necessary to attain power of 0.8.

In sum, while I face considerable uncertainty about effect sizes and variances before running the study, an N of 50 to 70 per treatment condition seems reasonable. It is not clear whether a small pilot study (with 15-30 respondents) would suffice to reduce this uncertainty in a meaningful way. To further improve power, to improve covariate balance, and to reduce the variability, I will estimate treatment effects adding pre-treatment covariates as control variables, and (alternatively) I will implement sequential blocking on pre-treatment covariates (after having collected the data, but without utilizing outcome data for blocking; see Moore and Moore 2011)."

The project aims at measuring impact on entrepreneurship, confidence, preferences, social attitudes, locus of control, family living conditions including school outcomes for the children, well-being and happiness. 

The idea behind the program is to reduce financial barriers and build capacity and confidence among the participants in the microfinance program, and to reduce prejudice in society by demonstrating the ability of women and disabled to manage and mobilize resources. 

Key questions of our research are: Does the 'We can manage!' program improve the livelihoods of the participants in these groups, and in particular the disabled and their families? Does it make them more confident? Does it reduce prejudice in society? Clearly, if the program has a positive impact on these (or related) dimensions, it will have improved the situation for perhaps the most vulnerable group in society: the disabled (females) in the rural area of a poor country.

iii.	Willingness to take risk

Happiness will be measured on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “very unhappy” and 5 is “very happy”

Trust will be measured on a scale from 1-4, based on the question “How much do you trust people in your village?”, where 1 is “Not at all” and 4 is “I trust them a lot”.

Locus of control is a dummy variable, which takes the value 1 if the respondent agreed more with statement A than statement B (and zero otherwise), where statement A is “The things that happen in your life are of your own doing” and statement B is “You don't have much control over what happens in life, or in the direction your life is headed”. 

School fees is the response to the question: “For how many children do you pay school fees?”

Attendance is a dummy for whether the child was present at school at the time of the school visit, with the identity of the child being confirmed by the research team.

We will also ask questions about attendance, payment of various school fees, and the child’s performance based on school records. However, based on experience from a pilot in March 2015, we know that these records will sometimes be unavailable and incomplete. We shall therefore consider Attendance as the main school outcome. 

Confidence is based on expected performance in a memory game. The participants were shown 10 items for 15 seconds, and then asked to name as many of these items as possible. They were also told that other villagers had conducted the same exercise. Before playing the same game one more time, they were asked (1) how many items they thought they would remember (0-10), and (2) how many they thought the other villagers on average had remembered (0-10). Confidence is measured as the difference between the first and the second question, where a person is said to be more confident the more positive is this difference. 

Willingness to compete is a dummy taking the value one if the participants choose the competition rate, and zero if they choose the fixed rate, in the memory game, where the fixed rate is 1000 Uganda Shilling for each item remembered, and the competition rate is 2000 Uganda Shilling for each item remembered, but only if the number of items remembered was at least as high as the village average, and zero otherwise.

We will also ask a question about Willingness to take risk, is an un-incentivized measure, based on the response to the following statement: “I am willing to take risks, in general”, where the scale ranged from zero to 10, with zero indicating “No, I am completely unwilling to take risks, in general” and 10 “Yes, I am completely willing to take risks, in general”. Since this is un-incentivized, and we don’t have a strong prior as to the direction of the treatment effect, we do not consider this to be a main outcome variable.
","","We initially recruited 75 groups from Manafwa, in Eastern Uganda. The target number of participants in each group was 30. A baseline survey was conducted during July and August 2013, with a total of 1916 participants.

","","The randomization procedure was as follows: First, in order to minimize spillovers between treatment and control groups, we constructed 63 unique “locations”, where a location could consist of more than one group in case a village supplied members into multiple groups. The groups linked by common village membership would then belong to the same location. In contrast, when a village only supplied participants into one group, the location would consist of a single group. Second, we randomly allocated the locations to treatment (31) or control (32).

This is consistent with the numbers reported to us from established WCM groups in Tororo and Kumi in a pilot study that we conducted April 2015: 70% reported to have been forced to hold children home from school due to the non-payment of school fees. The pilot revealed that, today, only 28% of them had similar problems. With an average of 7 parents on the a-list in each group, and taking into account clustering, we have a power of at least 90% (with a 5% confidence interval) to detect a 20 percentage point reduction in non-payment of schools fees."

","Previous empirical evidence has show that the program significantly reduces the number of violent-crime arrests among the treated youth. In addition to replicating the earlier finding on a larger study population, we are interested in isolating the components of the program that are most essential to producing the positive outcomes the City has enjoyed in recent years - e.g. whether reductions in violence have been driven simply by access to work and income, or by the prosocial and behavioral effects of mentoring.

In order to estimate the causal impact of the different program models on our measured outcomes, we randomly assigned eligible program applicants to one of three arms:one that provides a summer job and 24/7 access to an adult mentor as well as 5 hours of mentoring curriculum per week, one that provides the job only, and a control group of no services. Separating the components of the program model into two distinct treatment arms and a control group will allow for a straightforward causal estimate of the effects of the program on the number of violent-crime arrests among treated participants. 

In order to study the impact of provider-level characteristics, we employed a block-randomized design to randomly assign applicants to providers and treatment within geographic blocks. Using geocoded address data from the full list of eligible applicants, we designed six blocks based around clusters of providers that were of similar size and reasonable proximity. We also designed the blocks to account for the geographic density of the applicants in relation to the location of provider offices, allowing for an approximately equal probability of treatment across groups while attempting to minimize the average distance traveled by treatment participants. 

The block-randomized design will also allow us to examine secondary research questions, including investigating the variation in outcomes across providers. The 19 providers vary in size, operational capacity, and program experience. Exploring the scalability of the OSC program requires greater understanding of the nuances of what characteristics of providers are required for program success.
","Randomization was done in office, by computer. ","Individual participants were randomized to one of three or four providers and one of two treatment groups or a control within the geographic blocks.




",n/a,5444,"All six blocks contain study participants in both treatment arms and the control. The treatment arm breakdown in sample size for the entire study population is as follows:

1) 1258 observed youth were randomized to te treatment arm that paired a job with a weekly mentoring component.

2) 1246 youth were randomized to the treatment arm that only provided a job without the mentoring component.

3) 2940 youth were randomized to the control group of no services.","In a 2012 study, which recruited a similar population of youth and used identical data sources as the proposed project, baseline covariates explained between 0.1 and 0.5 of the variation in outcomes (less for arrests, more for schooling outcomes). Since we have no reason to suspect that the treatment effect will vary by blocks, we do not account for any variability at the block level. With these assumptions, the overall treatment-control contrast has a minimum detectable effect (MDE) of between 0.05 and 0.08 standard deviations. The across-treatment contrast has an MDE of 0.09 to 0.12 SDs."

Our study firm - a network of 238 retail stores located in an Eastern European EU member state - has been troubled with store staff turnover averaging at 90% per year, a figure high even for the retail sector standards. Turnover is expensive, costing about 400 Euros per quit worth of time spent finding and training up a replacement. Low pay and limited career options have been blamed for high store staff turnover. 

Yet, the fact that half of the leaving staff quit within the first three months on the job suggests that turnover could be reduced by better induction into the firm, which we believe can be accomplished through improved employer-employee communications. Hence, our first experimental treatment, labelled ""job induction"", is to send a letter signed by the firm CEO to the treatment group store managers motivating them to do what they can to reduce staff turnover. In particular, the letter mentions the importance of helping employees fully integrate into their teams, of training new hires, and of having an open ear for the concerns workers may have, especially in the beginning of their tenure. 

Our second treatment, labelled ""career communication"", is about communication with the staff regarding career options at our study firm.

 Leveraging Patients' Social Networks to Overcome Tuberculosis Under-detection in India,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/773,"November 12, 2015",2015-11-12 10:01:00 -0500,AEARCTR-0000773,"Jessica Goldberg, goldberg@econ.umd.edu",in_development,2015-09-01,2017-11-30,"[""health"", """"]","","In India alone, it is estimated that 3.5 million people suffer from Tuberculosis. The under-detection of TB represents a key challenge for health officials in developing countries because the success of any treatment program rests crucially on identifying those who have the disease. We propose to evaluate an approach with the potential to augment and strengthen the WHO’s global strategy for community engagement in the fight against TB. We will explore the use of financial incentives to encourage referrals, and we will focus on a specific community group with unique potential to generate referrals; current patients under treatment for TB. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of different types of financial incentives to encourage TB patients to refer people from within their social networks for TB screening and testing. We will vary the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), the method of outreach (""peer-to-peer outreach"" or ""provider promotional visits"") and whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). 
",2015-09-01,2017-11-30,"The key outcomes of interest in this experiment are: 

1. How many new patients enter treatment under each incentive scheme? Do financial incentives result in more new patients?
2. Which is more effective in enrolling new suspects, outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers?
3. What are the characteristics of new patients who enter treatment as a result of each treatment condition?
4. Which incentive scheme is most effective in causing new patients to complete treatment?
5. What is the role of stigma and other social cost in preventing current patients from referring new suspects? Do current patients refer more new suspects if they can remain anonymous? 
6. Do current patients behave strategically by bringing in false suspects as a result of financial incentives?
7. Do new patients who have received financial incentives for entering treatment behave differently when seeking care for other illnesses in the future?

We will collect data through the following sources:

1. Data recorded by Op ASHA's health counselors (including TB test results obtained from the DMCs)
2. Existing Patient surveys
3. New Patient surveys
4. Extra cards offer and cards buy-back 
","","All of Opertaion ASHA's DOTs centers will be divided into one of the following 9 treatment conditions and a pure control group.  All patients attending a given center who have been in treatment for at least two weeks, plus those who recently completed treatment, will be asked to participate in a TB detection scheme under one of the following 9 conditions: 

T0: Pure control group: No treatment whatsoever. Current patients will be simply surveyed at baseline. New patients will also be surveyed and asked whether current or previous Operation ASHA patient induced them to get tested and start treatment.

T1: Encouragement to refer new suspects (“CP-gives-out-cards”): Each current patient at these centers will receive ten referral cards and will be invited to give the cards to five different people whom they think should be tested for TB. 

T2: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer revealed”): Each current patient at these centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will be mentioned to the new suspects.

T3: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer anonymous”): This is the same as T2, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects. 

T4: CP-gives-out-cards + Unconditional Incentives: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB.

","Below we explain how our experimental design will allow us to answer our primary research questions. This will also clarify the marginal contribution of each treatment arm.

The experimental variation will allow us to test for the effectiveness of a variety of incentives, in order to identify the mechanisms through which barriers to referrals and treatment are alleviated. To measure the effects of our interventions, we will estimate versions (e.g., probit) of the following econometric model:

yij= α + βE ecnourage +  βR reward +  βB bonus + βN names +βA anonym + γXi +Tt + εijt 

where i denotes the individual patients, j the randomly assigned treatment condition, and t the month of the intervention. yij represents the outcome variable of interest (e.g., yi = 1 if patient i made a referral, and 0 otherwise; or yi = 1 if patient i referred someone who tested positive for TB, and 0 otherwise). The key parameters of interest on the right-hand side of model (1) are the treatment effects βk, with the constant α representing, all else equal, the response in the pure control condition T0. First of all, the estimated coefficient βE will reveal whether encouragement to refer new suspects has an effect, even in the absence of incentives. In fact, an explicit appeal accompanied by referral cards might increase the salience of the request, thereby increasing referrals. Second, comparing βR and βE will determine whether financial rewards are effective at inducing current patients to find and refer new suspects (Q1). Third, comparing βB vs. βR will allow us to assess the extent to which unconditional incentives induce strategic behavior on the part of patients to refer individuals who are not sick only to obtain the reward (Q2a) and whether the current patients have concrete information on the health status of their social contacts (Q2b). Specifically, if patients in the unconditional incentive arm behave opportunistically by disproportionally referring people who are not sick, the number of referrals made will be higher and the share that test positive for TB smaller compared to those for patients in the bonus condition. Such a result will also indicate that patients do have information about the health condition of their social contacts (or an obtain it by exerting more effort). Fourth, comparison between βN and βE will reveal whether outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers is more effective in enrolling new suspects (Q3). Since current patients may also contact new suspects when they receive incentives based on intake of those new suspects, we can also estimate differences-in-differences specifications that include the interaction between eligibility for a reward, and outreach by peers vs. health workers. Finally, the estimated coefficient βA will inform us about the role of stigma and other “social costs” in making current patients reluctant to make referrals (Q4). For example, if we found that the share of referrals who are TB positive is higher when the referrer remains anonymous, that would indicate that stigma and related social costs are indeed a barrier that is making patients reluctant to approach others in their social circles who are likely also sick. Tt are month fixed effects, included to control for seasonality effects and other unobservable factors associated with the different intervention periods. Individual characteristics (including demographics such as age and gender, and other characteristics such as personality traits, experience with the disease and the clinic, etc.) will be reported in the vector of controls Xi. εijt is the error term. Because the randomization was done at the center level, we adjust the standard errors by allowing for clustering by center.
",Randomization will be done in the office by a computer using STATA programming ,"Our unit of randomization is the Op ASHA DOTS (Directly Observable Treatment Short-Course) centers. We will roll out the intervention across all of Op ASHA’s 200 DOTs centers in a period of 18 months. DOTS centers will be divided into four groups or data collection cycles. Each cycle will include anywhere between 18 and 40 centers, based on the spread of centers across geographic areas. For each cycle, the project randomizes the outreach type and the incentives at the center- level, with stratification based on geographic location.  The centers will then be randomized into one of nine treatment arms and a control arm before the start of a data collection cycle.  With one pure control and nine treatment conditions, there will be 20 centers and 400 subjects (current patients) in each treatment arm. ",We expect to run the experiment in 150 DOTS Centers across India. We are however constrained by the fact that the number of Op ASHA centers and the number of patients in each center is constantly evolving. ,"5,000 patients ","Patients in Operation ASHA’s centers will be randomly assigned to a pure control condition and nine treatment conditions as follows:

Treatment 1: 20 patients in 20 DOTS centers will receive ten referral cards and will be invited to give the cards to ten different people whom they think should be tested for TB

Treatment 2:  20 patients in 20 centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will be mentioned to the new suspects. 

Treatment 3: 20 patients in 20 centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will not be mentioned to the new suspects.  
Treatment 4: 20 patients in 20 centers will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB.

 Treatment 5: 20 patients in 20 centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will be mentioned to the new suspects. Patients will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB.

Treatment 6: 20 patients in 20 centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will not be mentioned to the new suspects.  Patients will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB.

Treatment 7: 20 patients in 20 centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB

Treatment 8:  Same as T5, except 20 patients in 20 centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB

Treatment 9: Same as T6, except 20 patients in 20 centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB

Control: 400 patients in 20 centers will be given no treatment whatsoever. Patients in these centers will be simply surveyed at baseline and at endline
","We use the results of a pilot study to determine whether our study is sufficiently powered to detect economically meaningful effects. Since we are proposing multiple treatments, we make hypothetical comparisons between different combinations of pairs. Specifically, we compare the “encouragement” condition (T1) with the “Rs. 150 unconditional incentive for referrers” treatment condition (T4). Treatment is assigned at the center level. Because we are comparing pairs of treatments, and because each treatment condition will be assigned to 20 centers, the number of clusters in our calculations below is 40. We focus on three key outcomes of interest: Y1 = 1 if the patient made at least one referral, 0 otherwise; Y2 = N. of referrals made by the patient; Y3 = Number of TB positive referrals made by the patient.  

Given the standard deviation of the outcome variables, the effects found in a pilot study imply the following effect sizes (effect/standard deviation): 0.45 for Y1, 0.58 for Y2, and 0.59 for Y3. 

The intra-class correlations within centers from the pilot are as follows: Y1 ICC = 0.07; Y2 ICC = 0.13; Y3 ICC = 0.14. 
The minimum detectable effect sizes are 0.31 for Y1, 0.38 for Y2, and 0.39 for Y3 assuming 0.80 power; and 0.36 for Y1, 0.44 for Y2, and 0.45 for Y3 assuming 0.90 power. 

Given that the effects we obtained in the pilot are substantially larger than those computed in these power calculations, we conclude that our proposed sample sizes of 20 sites for T0-T9 are appropriate to detect effects of meaningful size.  Note that in the pilot, the incentives conditional on TB test results delivered effects similar in magnitude to those of the encouragement condition. In the full-scale experiment, we have increased the expected value of the conditional reward to match that of the unconditional one, which we anticipate will increase its size effect.

In the risk preferences, our analysis will be the same as in Choi et al. (2007) and Choi et al. (2014). For the time preferences, we can do further analysis about dynamic inconsistencies between two time treatments. In addition to the GARP analysis, we can also conduct a test about stochastic dominace in the risk preference data.

2) Demand analysis
  2.1) Nonparametric analysis of demand: we can define a simple statistic of demand behaviour under risk and over time. For the risk preference data, we define the average fraction of money allocated to a cheaper asset as a nonparametric measure of risk tolerance. If the subject is risk neutral, this measure is equal to 1. If the subject is extremely risk averse, this measure is equal to 1/2.

For the time preference data, we can define the average fraction of money allocated to a sooner payment date as a nonparametric measure of impatience. If the subject is very patient, this measure is close to zero. The more impatient the subject is, the higher this measure is.

 2.2) Parametric analysis of demand: In this part, we can conduct a model-based estimation of risk preferences and time preferences. For the risk preference data, we intend to use the rank-dependent utility model to estimate both standard risk aversion coefficient and a parameter about probability weighting.

For the time preference data, we can use a variety of models about intertemporal choices. First of all, we can estimate quasi-hyperbolic model with stationary per-period utility function, commonly called (beta, delta) model. We can then extend the analysis by allowing per-period utility function to be time varying.   
","RISK: subjects are asked to allocate a budget between two risky assets, each one of which obtains with a probability of 0.5. The assets have different payoffs, so that allocations give an indication of risk preferences (see description in Choi et al. 2007 and Choi et al. 2014).

Promoting Early Grade Reading & Numeracy in Tanzania,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/291,"July 23, 2015",2015-02-09 17:52:27 -0500,AEARCTR-0000291,"Karthik Muralidharan, kamurali@ucsd.edu",on_going,2013-02-06,2015-12-31,"[""education"", """"]",I21,"Overall student learning levels remain extremely low across East Africa, despite a decade plus of major reforms and significant new investments in public education. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, recent nationwide surveys show that large majorities of children are unable to read or do arithmetic at the required level (Uwezo at Twaweza, 2011). While the challenges facing the education sector are well known, existing reforms and aid instruments have largely failed to improve the situation.

At present, the two main approaches used by governments to improve the quality of education in East Africa are to strengthen teacher training and to disburse a capitation grant for books and related activities to schools. On the former, several studies show formal levels of teacher qualification to be weakly correlated to performance. On the latter, it is difficult to establish the impact of capitation grants on improving learning outcomes because the full amounts of the grant have not consistently reached schools and because they have not been rigorously evaluated. At the same time, even if funds were to flow well, under current arrangements no one is held accountable or incentivized to achieve learning. The lack of adequate attention to accountability and incentives may in part explain why increased budgets for education have not resulted in improved learning outcomes. So while government programs have largely focused on providing educational inputs, recent evidence suggests that it may be more effective to incentivize the delivery of learning outcomes, particularly at the local level (see Glewwe and Kremer 2005, and Kremer and Holla 2009).

In short, we see three key challenges to improving education in East Africa: (1) how to consistently get resources to the lowest (school/community) levels, (2) how to effectively invest (government and donor) resources by gearing the education process to emphasize learning outcomes rather than educational inputs, and (3) how to generate rigorous evidence of what works and have it inform national education debate, policy and practice. 

In this project we seek to evaluate the impact of two separate approaches to improving early grade learning outcomes. We seek to evaluate the impact of providing schools with extra resources in the form of capitation grants (a grant per child enrolled) and the impact of providing teachers with incentives to achieve foundational learning outcomes in early grades (teachers receive a small bonus for each student that achieves an appropriate learning outcome). In addition we will evaluate the combination of the two approaches (i.e. capitation grants and teacher incentives).

The evaluation is being implemented in 350 government primary schools in 10 districts in Tanzania between 2013 and 2014.
",2013-03-07,2015-02-28,"The main outcome variables are students test scores, as a proxy for student learning. Assuming we are able to establish that the treatments had an impact in students test scores, secondary outcome variables would try to establish spillover effects, the mechanisms behind the main treatment effects and how the treatment effects vary across student, household, teacher and school characteristics.

A sample of 30 students per school (10 students from Grades 1, 2, and 3) are to be tested in all treatment schools and in 140 control schools. Students will be tested before the intervention begins, at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year. The information of these test will be used to calculate standardized test scores and compare achievement for children across treatment groups. We also collect detailed student information  (e.g.  age and gender); detailed school information (e.g. facilities, management practices and head teacher characteristics), detailed teacher information (e.g. education, age, experience and self reported time use), and detailed household information (e.g. parents engagement in child's education, parents own education, household composition, and assets owned by the household).  

The information from our household, teacher and schools survey can be used to identify the mechanisms through which the treatment affects test scores. For example, we can look at the change in learning outcomes in non-incentivized subjects; how teachers spend their time in school; how schools spent the funds of the Capitation Grants (e.g. text books, scholarships, meals, etc); whether schools increased the hours taught in the incentivized subjects; and whether household become more or less engaged in the child's education after the intervention. Using the base line survey we can study how the treatment effects differ across student, household, teacher and school characteristics.","The main outcomes variables will be standardized test scores. First, we will construct a standardized test score for each subject in each grade, by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group. Once we have subject-grade standardized test scores, we will add these up across grades and the re-normalize (dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group); this will yield subject standardized test score. 

For some analysis we will also aggregate test scores across subjects by summing them and the re-normalizing (dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group).","This evaluation was conducted in 350 schools in 10 randomly selected districts across Tanzania. All government primary schools were eligible in each of the 10 districts, but 35 schools were randomly selected from each district to be part of the evaluation. The probability that a school was chosen was proportional to the number of students enrolled in the school. In each sampled district, 14 schools were assigned to the control group and 7 schools were assigned to each treatment group, CG, COD and Combination. 

The aims of the three treatment groups are as follows:
1. Capitation Grant (CG): Test the impact of providing capitation grants (while providing the community with information on these grants) on improving basic literacy and numeracy.
2. Cash on Delivery (COD): Test the impact of incentivizing teachers to achieve previously set, absolute levels of learning among students in Grades 1, 2, and 3.

Our main outcomes (the effect of capitation grants and cash on delivery) have a total of 280 clusters (140 controls schools and 140 treatment schools - 70 with the pure treatment and 70 with the combination treatment). In other words to estimate the effect of the capitation grant we have 140 control schools and 140 schools that recieve the capitation grant, 70 from Treatment 1 and 70 from Treatment 3. Similarly, we have 140 schools that receive Cash on Delivery. To estimate the interaction between the two main treatments we only have 70 treatment schools (Treatment 3) and 140 controls schools.

We analyze a randomized trial of nudged exercise commitment contracts in the context of a time-inconsistent intertemporal utility maximization model of the demand for exercise. The trial follows more than 4,000 people seeking to make exercise commitments. Each person was randomly nudged towards making longer (20 weeks) or shorter (8 weeks) exercise commitment contracts. 

Our empirical analysis shows that people who are interested in exercise commitment contracts choose longer contracts when nudged to do so, and are then more likely to meet their pre-stated exercise goals.  People are also more likely to enroll in a subsequent commitment contract after the original expires if they receive a nudge for a longer duration initial contract.  Our theoretical analysis of the welfare implications of these effects shows conditions under which nudges can reduce utility even when they succeed in the goal of promoting habitual exercise.

We will recruit respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will run two separate experiments in which we expose our treatment group to a prime that triggers feelings of poverty Mani et al. (2013). In each experiment we recruit 972 participants. In the first experiment we examine the effect of poverty primes on behavior in a public goods game and the behavior of a first mover in a trust game. In the second experiment we explore the consequences of feeling poor on the behavior of the second mover in a ultimatum game and on the behavior of the punisher in a third-party punishment game. This plan outlines the design of the experiments, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore.
",2015-08-15,2015-08-16," 
Public Goods Game: Each respondent will play a game with three other MTurkers. All players will start with $50 each. Then, every player will have the possibility of contributing some of their $50 to a project, without knowing the contributions of the other players. The sum of the contributions made by the four players will then be multiplied by two, and all of the money will then be split equally among all four players. Thus, a player's total payoff consists of two parts: 1) The part of the $50 that the player did not contribute to the project, 2) plus the payoff the player receives from the project, which is equal to 0.5 x (the sum of the contributions made by all four players).Therefore, each player's total payoff is:($50 - the player's contribution to the project) + 0.5 x (the sum of the contributions made by all four players to the project). Once everyone has completed the survey, we will randomly form groups of four MTurkers. We will choose one group at random, and implement the choices made by the four players in that group.  
Mechanisms Public Goods game: Directly after specifying their contribution in the public goods game, our participants will be asked various questions ecliciting beliefs about others' likely contributions, their fairness concerns and their understanding: How much money do you think the other players will contribute to the project on average? (Players are told that they receive 5 cents of they guess the other player's contributions correctly)
Imagine that each of the other three players contributed $25 to the project. How much money would you contribute to the project in that case? 
Imagine that, of the other three players, one contributes $0, one contributes $25 and one contributes $50. How much money would you contribute to the project in that case? Please click on the slider to choose the amount.
Imagine that you wanted to earn as much money as possible from this game. How much money should you then contribute to the project? If you give the correct answer, you will receive an extra 5 cents.

Trust:  We will ask our respondents to complete a game in which there are two players, whom we shall refer to as person A and  person B. All of our respondent's (except for one) will play the role of person A. Person A and person B start with $50 each. Then, person A can choose to send some money to person B. Person B will receive 3 times the amount sent by person A. Then person B will have to choose how much money to send back to person A. Once everyone has completed the survey, we will randomly choose one participant in our survey who played the role of A to get their choice implemented and we will randomly choose one participant to play the role of B and get their choice implemented. 
 Mechanisms Trust Game: After completing the trust game:

Our respondent's will be asked the following question:
 ""What amount do you think will Person B send back to you?""

Third Party Punishment:   
There are three players in this game: Player A, Player B and Player C. Our respondents will play the role of player C. All three players start with $100 each. This game has two stages. Stage 1: In this stage, Player A is the only one who has a decision to make. At the beginning of this stage, Player A receives an extra $100, which he or she can share with Player B. In particular, Player A can give either $0, $10, $20, $30, $40 or $50 to Player B. Stage 2: In this stage, Player C is the only one who has a decision to make. At the beginning of this stage, Player C receives an extra $50. 
Player C can use this extra $50 to reduce Player A's payoff, based on how much money Player A gave to Player B. For every $1 that Player C spends, Player A's payoff goes down by $2. We then ask our respondents how much money they want to spend to reduce Player A's payoff, for all of Player A's possible choices.
Mechanisms Third Party Punishment Game:
Costless punishment: We ask our respondents to consider again case where Person A doesn't give any money to Person B. But this time, imagine that Person C does not need to give up some of their $50 in order to reduce Person A's payoff. 
Fairness concerns: Moreover, we shed light on our respondents' fairness concerns by asking them the following question: In order to be fair, how much money should Person A give to Person B? Please click on the slider to choose the appropriate offer?


Negative Reciprocity: We ask our respondents to complete a game in which there are two players, whom we shall refer to as person 1 and  person 2. All of our respondent's (except for one) will play the role of person 2.  At the beginning of this game, person 1 receives \$100, while person 2 receives nothing. Then, person 1 has to make an offer to person 2 on how to split the $100. Person 2 chooses either to accept the offer made by person 1, or to refuse it. If person 2 refuses the offer, both players receive nothing. If person 2 accepts the offer, each player receives the amount specified in the offer. Then our respondents specify the minimum amount that person 1 would have to offer them, in order for them to accept their offer?  Once everyone has completed the survey, we will randomly choose one participant in our survey who played the role of person 2 to get their choice implemented and we will randomly choose one participant to play the role of person 1 and get their choice implemented.  
Mechanism Negative Reciprocity: After completing the ultimatum game, we ask the second mover the following question:
 In order to be fair, what offer should person 1 make to person 2? 
 Cognitive Function: Raven’s Progressive Matrices: This task measures fluid intelligence. Each trial consists of a 3x3 matrix of figures, with the bottom right figure missing.
Respondents are asked to choose the correct figure, from a set of 8 candidate figures, which best completes the overall pattern of the matrix. Respondents must complete five matrices without any time limits. They receive a payoff of 5 cents for each correct answer. In this task, we measure the number of correct answers and reaction time. Risk-preferences: In addition, we include a standard risk-preference measure in which individuals choose one out of six lotteries with different levels of risk Eckel and Grossman (2003)

 
Financial worries scale: This 3-item questionnaire provides an addition manipulation check for our poverty primes. We ask respondents to self-report on a Likert scale how worried they are about their financial situation.
 
","","
 We have adapted the poverty primes by Mani et al. (2013) to the MTurk environment. As in  \cite{mani2013}, we present our respondents with hypothetical scenarios, each of which describes a financial problem. We randomly assign our respondents to either a hard or an easy financial scenario. 

In the first financial scenario they need to explain how they would deal with an income decrease of 20% (5%) in the hard (easy) financial scenario. We then ask them a variety of questions on whether this income shock would substantially affect their situation and what kind of sacrifices they would need to make. In the second scenario people explain how they would deal with a situation in which they need to come up with an amount of money: In the hard (easy) financial scenario respondents are asked how they would come up with $3000 ($150) in a short notice. The order with which these financial scenarios is presented is randomized. Respondents write down how they might deal with the financial scenarios. The aim of exposure to these scenarios is to trigger feelings of poverty.  

We have made two main changes to the primes used by Mani et al. (2013): first, we increased the amounts for the hard financial scenarios. Second, we removed two financial scenarios because they did not seem well-suited for the MTurk population. We have conducted a pilot study with a sample of 350 participants on August 1st in which we document that our two primes successfully affect financial worries. In particular, poorer individuals from our sample are quite strongly affected by our treatment: They display substantially stronger financial worries. The primes are further explained in Appendix A. Moreover, at the very end of the document we attach the exact experimental instructions.

Impact Evaluation of the DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition of the Extreme Poor in Bangladesh,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/927,"October 29, 2015",2015-10-29 13:46:36 -0400,AEARCTR-0000927,"Naureen Karachiwalla, n.karachiwalla@cgiar.org",on_going,2013-09-01,2015-12-31,"[""health"", """"]",I12; I15; J13,"Undernutrition is widespread in Bangladesh. In 2011, according to the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 41.3 per cent of children under age five were stunted, 36.4 per cent were underweight, 15.6 per cent were wasted, and more than 50 per cent were anaemic. Prevalences were even higher among extremely poor households. Meanwhile, evidence from South Asia shows that high rates of economic growth and reduction in poverty have not led to similarly large reductions in undernutrition (e.g., Smith et al. 2002; Ramalingaswami, Jonsson, and Rohde 1996; Deaton and Dreze 2009). These findings have suggested that improvements in income alone may not be sufficient to improve nutritional status. Extensive research has also shown that the critical window for nutritional interventions is during the ""first thousand days"" of life (e.g., Bhutta et al. 2013; Hoddinott et al. 2013), from the time when a child is in utero until about two years of age. Based on this accumulated evidence, growing attention has come to introducing nutrition interventions that target children's ""first thousand days"" alongside household poverty reduction programmes. In particular, there has been growing emphasis on nutrition interventions that aim to improve infant and young child feeding practices - through increasing nutritional knowledge of women who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to be pregnant in the future - as well as to improve the nutritional status of these women themselves.

Although there exists considerable evidence assessing the effectiveness of various livelihoods interventions and other social protection programmes, as well as some evidence on the effectiveness of various direct nutritional interventions, little research directly assesses how an integrated livelihoods and nutrition programme might compare with livelihoods support alone. There are several reasons why the combination of nutrition and livelihoods support may have nutritional benefits over and above livelihoods support only. First, a key constraint to improved nutritional status may be insufficient knowledge of appropriate infant and young child feeding practices (for example, the appropriate duration of exclusive breastfeeding, the appropriate frequency and diversity of child feeding thereafter, etc.). If this is the case, then improving income alone will not necessarily lead to improved feeding practices. Second, there may be synergies between the two types of support. For example, even if a mother's knowledge of infant and young child feeding practices improves, she may still need access to sufficient resources for undertaking those practices (such as income to purchase the recommended types of food), which can be facilitated through a livelihoods intervention. Third, there may be other dynamics shifted through the direct nutrition intervention that mediate how the livelihoods intervention affects nutritional status. For example, if a direct nutrition intervention targeting women improves women's bargaining power within the household, and if women tend to prefer devoting more resources to young children's nutrition (e.g., Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003), the result may also be larger impacts on nutritional status than livelihoods support alone.

The DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition for the Extreme Poor in Bangladesh aims to improve nutrition outcomes for young children, pregnant and lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. Its approach is to integrate direct nutrition interventions into the livelihood support currently provided to extremely poor households in Bangladesh through three existing programmes: the Chars Livelihoods Programme (CLP), the Shiree Economic Empowerment of the Poorest Programme (Shiree or EEP, within which we focus on the Concern subproject), and the Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction Programme (UPPR).

In order to rigorously and independently assess the impacts of these integrated nutrition and livelihoods programmes, DFID has collaborated with research partners and implementation partners to undertake a mixed methods impact evaluation, entitled ""Impact Evaluation of the DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition for the Extreme Poor in Bangladesh."" The evaluation team includes IDS (the lead organisation), IFPRI, ITAD, CNRS, and BRAC University. The evaluation uses mixed quantitative and qualitative methods within a strong theory-based design to assess the impacts of the integrated programmes on nutritional status.

The quantitative impact component involves a baseline survey (conducted in September-November 2013) and an endline survey (to be conducted in November-December 2015). The exploratory/explanatory component includes a qualitative subcomponent (for which the first phase of fieldwork has been ongoing since February 2014), as well as a process evaluation subcomponent (ongoing since July 2014, final results not yet available). The cost effectiveness component began in August 2014 and will be completed in early 2016 following the quantitative endline survey completion.

The three key research questions regarding programme impact that will be addressed are:
1. What is the impact on nutrition outcomes of receiving a combination of livelihoods and direct nutrition interventions (denoting this scenario (L+N)), relative to receiving a livelihoods intervention only (denoting this scenario (L))?
2. What is the impact on nutrition outcomes of receiving a combination of livelihoods and direct nutrition interventions (L+N), relative to receiving no intervention (denoting this scenario (C) for control)?
3. What is the impact on nutrition outcomes of receiving a livelihoods intervention only (L), relative to receiving no intervention (C)? 
Research questions 2 and 3 will pertain only to the urban group served by UPPR.

In order to construct a proxy for the (L+N) households in the counterfactual (L) scenario, randomisation is used. Among the households that already receive the livelihoods intervention at baseline, half are randomly assigned to additionally receive the nutrition intervention after the baseline (denoted the (L+N) group). The remaining half continue to receive only the livelihoods intervention (denoting the (L) group). Randomisation is conducted at the level of primary sampling units (PSUs) that cover an entire locality, rather than at the level of individual households. The randomisation makes it very likely that characteristics of the (L) and (L+N) groups will on average be similar at baseline. (L) is then a valid proxy for (L+N), and average differences between the groups at endline can be interpreted as impacts caused only by the addition of the nutrition component rather than pre-existing differences.

In order to construct a proxy for the (L+N) households in the counterfactual (C) scenario of no intervention, non-randomised approaches are used. Since none of the original livelihoods interventions was rolled out following a randomised control trial design, there is no obvious set of comparable non-beneficiaries to serve as the counterfactual. Because a control group is nonetheless required to assess the absolute benefits of either (L) or (L + N) interventions, attempts were made to construct the best possible control group out of non-randomly selected non-beneficiaries. Baseline data were collected on potential control groups for all three programmes.  Exploratory matching analysis showed that the control group for only UPPR was sufficiently comparable to serve as a potentially valid counterfactual.  Therefore questions regarding absolute benefits will be addressed only for UPPR, not for CLP or Shiree.

This paper uses an experiment where individuals who have been on welfare for more than two years in a French district were randomly allocated to a counseling firm. We show that the policy causal impact is to increase employment and decrease the amounts of welfare transfers paid to the beneficiaries. However, the effects are small relative to the cost charged by the providing firm. Therefore, the net public cost, accounting for gains in welfare transfer payment, remains larger than reasonable social values that can be attached to having a former welfare recipient on a job.

I also aim to identify how much workers are willing-to-pay to obtain additional information about safety. To study these questions, I conduct a field experiment with 312 garment workers who live in Savar, a sub-district of Dhaka home to hundreds of garment factories. In the field experiment, I provide a randomly selected group of workers with information about their factories’ performances, and the performances of numerous factories nearby, on third-party safety audits.

We will recruit 2000 respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk and expose our treatment group to a prime that triggers feelings of poverty (Mani et al., 2013). Then, participants complete ten Raven progressive matrices and 75 items of a Stroop task. The design of the study is a replication of the study by  (Mani et al., 2013). This plan outlines the design of the experiments, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore.







",2015-08-10,2015-08-11,"- Stroop task: Our participants will be presented with a series of color words (blue, yellow, green, red). These words will appear in different colors, sometimes matching the word (e.g., the word blue, written in blue), and sometimes not matching the word (e.g., the word blue, written in yellow). The respondent's task is to indicate, as quickly and accurately as possible, the color in which the word is written, whether or not that matches the word itself. They are supposed to click the letter on the keyboard that matches the first letter of the color of the word. We incentivize the responses to this task by giving 1 cent for each correct answer, but reducing participants payoffs by 2 cents per 10 seconds it takes them to complete all items in the Stroop task and their payoff from this task cannot go negative. Respondents must complete 75 items without any time limits. In this task, we measure the number of correct answers and reaction time. We are interested in the number of correct responses and the response time to the incongruent items (where meaning of word and color do not match).

- Raven Progressive Matrices: This task measures fluid intelligence. Each trial consists of a pattern, with part of the pattern missing. Respondents are asked to choose the correct figure, from a set of 8 candidate figures, which best completes the overall pattern. We incentivize the responses to this task by giving five cents for each correct answer. Respondents must complete ten questions without any time limits. In this task, we measure the number of correct answers and reaction time. We have chosen Raven matrices that were neither too easy nor too hard based on a Pilot of 50 respondents from MTurk on August 4th.

- Financial Worries: This 4-item questionnaire provides an additional manipulation check for our poverty primes. We ask respondents to self-report on a Likert scale how worried they are about their financial situation.
 
- Satisfaction with income 

- MacArthur Socioeconomic Ladder

","","We have adapted the poverty primes by Mani et al. (2013) to the MTurk environment. As in Mani et al. (2013), we present our respondents hypothetical scenarios, each of which describes a financial problem. We randomly assign our respondents to either a hard or an easy financial scenario.

In the first financial scenario they need to explain how they would deal with an income decrease of 20% (5%) in the hard (easy) financial scenario. We then ask them a variety of questions on whether this income shock would substantially affect their situation and what kind of sacrifices they would need to make. In the second scenario people explain how they would deal with a situation in which they need to come up with an amount of money: In the hard (easy) financial scenario respondents are asked how they would come up with $3000 ($150) in a short notice. The order with which these financial scenarios is presented is randomized. Respondents write down how they might deal with the financial scenarios. The aim of exposure to these scenarios is to trigger feelings of poverty.

We have made two main changes to the primes used by Mani et al. (2013): first, we increased the amounts for the hard financial scenarios. Second, we removed two financial scenarios because they did not seem well-suited for the MTurk population. We have conducted a pilot study with a sample of 350 participants on August 1st in which we document that our two primes successfully affect financial worries. In particular, poorer individuals from our sample are quite strongly affected by our treatment: They display substantially stronger financial worries and lower levels of satisfaction with income.","",Randomization is done using a computer.,Individual.,2000 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk.,2000 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk.,"1000 treatment individuals;

(2013) are between 0.8 of a standard deviation and 1 standard deviation, we can be confident that our sample is sufficiently large to provide us with sufficient statistical power to detect effects.

Prior literature argues that audit firm rotation may enhance auditor independence because it reduces economic incentives to retain the client. This study goes beyond the economic effects and considers the effects of the rotation requirement on the personal relationship between the auditor and the client. Based on the dual concern model, we argue that a weaker personal relationship between both parties due to the rotation requirement can hinder effective auditor-client negotiations. In contrast, the personal relationship that develops when the auditor is retained for several periods can enable integrative solutions. Moreover, we argue that the positive effects of a personal relationship can be realized especially when the auditor has sufficient power. To test our hypotheses, we follow an experimental economics approach. This approach enables us to disentangle financial incentives from affective commitment arising from a personal relationship.",2015-10-06,2015-10-30,"The main dependent measure is the auditor's negotiation strategy. It is specified by the number of messages auditors choose from the five available strategy options presented in a negotiation catalogue: avoiding, conceding, contending, compromising, or integrative strategies. ","","We implement an experimental economics approach with incentivized multi-period interaction among student-subjects. The experiment is designed as a modified version of the standard two-player trust game. In a trust game, investor-subjects receive an initial endowment and decide how much of their endowment to send to an anonymous responder-subject. The responder receives a multiple share of the investment and likewise decides which share to return. In the modified version, the decision of the responder is subject to approval by an independent supervising body that we refer to as gatekeeper. The gatekeeper reflects an external auditor who negotiates with the responder about the return on investment and decides on behalf of the investor whether the returned share is appropriate or not. 

We capture the modified trust game in a five-stage experimental design. Before the experiment begins, student-subjects are randomly assigned to one of the three experimental roles as investor, manager, or auditor. In the first stage, investor-subjects receive an initial endowment and decide whether or not to entrust resources to the manager. Managers receive a multiple share of the investment in the second stage, and communicate their preferred distribution to the auditor. In the third stage, auditors may convince the manager to return higher shares to the investor by sending the manager text-messages. We refer to the interaction between auditors and managers as negotiation process. In the forth stage, managers receive the auditor's message and decide which share to return to the investor. Finally, in the fifth stage, auditors accept or reject the manager's return on behalf of the investors. This five-stage trust game describes one experimental round. Each subject participates in 15 experimental rounds.

Hypotheses:

H1a: Auditors apply integrative negotiation strategies less frequently when audit-firm rotation is mandated than when its not.
H1b: Auditors reject outcomes that fall short of their negotiation aim more often when audit-firm rotation is mandated than when its not.

H2a: Auditors apply contending negotiation strategies more frequently when their power position is strong than when its weak.
H2b: Auditors reject outcomes that fall short of their negotiation aim more often when their power position is strong than when its weak.

One type of dropouts (Type 1) is made up of enrollees for whom the course may not be appropriate. For these students, the optimal set-up might be one that allows students to “shop”—enroll in a course, discover whether the content or level is appropriate, and then drop out if need be after feeling sufficiently informed, but before too much time has been invested in making the choice. Another type of dropouts (Type 2) may be made up of enrollees for whom the course is appropriate, and who intend to complete it, but face small barriers that inhibit them from doing so. Discouragement could be one of those barriers. If learning objectives are imprecise, students may underestimate the relevance of the course, or focus on the wrong teaching points. This could lead to poor performance, which in turn feeds discouragement and ultimately fuels drop out. Therefore a model that makes learning objectives clear upfront could lead to reduced attrition over time.

Data-Driven Instruction in Honduras: An Impact Evaluation of the EducAcción Promising Reading Intervention,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/780,"October 05, 2015",2015-10-05 11:27:28 -0400,AEARCTR-0000780,"Chantal Toledo, ctoledo@mathematica-mpr.com",on_going,2014-10-01,2017-07-31,"[""education"", """"]",I20,"As policymakers’ focus in developing countries shifts from school access to school quality, student assessment has come to the fore. Governments use assessment data not only to monitor educational progress, but to provide feedback aimed at improving teaching and learning. In this evaluation, we focus on the potential effects of formative assessment (FA), in which teachers use frequent assessments of their students to improve their teaching, and end-of-grade (EOG) summative assessments, which, like FAs, can be the basis for teachers and principals to adapt their teaching practices and curricula to better meet the needs of their students. 

We undertake a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 180 schools in Honduras, complemented by qualitative analysis, to estimate the impacts of providing print materials and pedagogical support to maximize teachers’ ability to take advantage of these assessments. To do this, we randomize schools into 3 experimental groups: EOG wrap-around support and FA with support (Group A), EOG wrap-around support only (Group B), and ongoing programming by Honduras’ Ministry of Education (MOE) (Group C, the control group). Group C has limited access to printed FA materials from the Ministry’s previous efforts to distribute them. All schools administer an EOG test, but only schools in Groups A and B receive the intervention’s training and wrap-around support. We collected baseline data in October and November 2014 at the end of the school year. We conducted random assignment in January 2015. The intervention began in June 2015 and we began baseline analysis in June 2015. We will collect follow-up data at the end of 2015 and 2016. 

This design allows us to answer three main sets of research questions. First, we will compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group A to those in schools assigned to group B. This first comparison allows us to provide unbiased estimates of the impact of the FA intervention, holding constant the EOG wrap-around support intervention. Second, we will compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group B to those in schools assigned to group C. This comparison allows us to provide unbiased estimates of the impact of the EOG wrap-around support intervention compared to the ongoing programming provided by MOE and other organizations. Third, we will also be able to compare the outcomes of teachers and students in schools assigned to group A to those in schools assigned to group C. This comparison allows us to provide unbiased estimates of the impact of the combined use of EOG wrap-around support and FA with support, compared to the ongoing programming provided by MOE and other organizations. We will estimate each intervention’s impact on process outcomes (teachers’ access to assessment materials and results), intermediate outcomes (teachers’ use of assessment results to modify instruction), and final outcomes (learning, as measured by EOG tests and an independent assessment). We will estimate impacts at the end of the first and second years of the interventions (the 2015 and 2016 academic years). We will evaluate impacts on teaching methods at the end of both years, and will evaluate impacts on reading and math test scores at the end of the second year of the intervention. 

This study will also include an implementation study which will help demonstrate how the interventions are implemented in reality, and if the implementation differed from the original plans. The implementation study will consist of gathering and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data on what interventions were implemented, and how. Qualitative data collection will consist of key informant interviews and focus groups. In addition, if we find that the intervention is effective, we will also conduct cost-effectiveness analysis. 

A rigorous evaluation of the impact of these types of assessments in Honduras will contribute to a growing body of evidence on what works to improve early grade reading in primary schools, and more generally will test the effectiveness and costs of promising reading and education-access interventions. This evaluation is part of a five-year project to rigorously evaluate and cost United States Agency for International Development (USAID) investments in early literacy and access to education in conflict settings in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Mathematica is currently leading multi-year studies in four countries: Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru. This intervention and the evaluation of the intervention are funded by USAID.

1) process outcomes (teachers’ access to assessment materials and results)
2) intermediate outcomes (teachers’ use of assessment results to modify instruction)
3) final outcomes (academic achievement, as measured by end of grade tests and an independent assessment). 

We will study impacts on process and intermediate outcomes at the teacher and school levels, and will estimate final outcomes on learning at the student level. We will estimate impacts at the end of the first and second years of the interventions  (the 2015 and 2016 academic years). ","","After identifying our sample of 180 schools, we randomly assigned each school to one of the three experimental groups described above (A, B or c) with equal probabilities. We implemented random assignment in two steps to ensure that the random assignment would result in three groups that were balanced geographically, in terms of baseline exposure to the interventions and in terms of baseline performance. First, we divided each of four departments' (states') schools into a high or low baseline use group, according to their score on an index measuring baseline use of formative and end of grade assessment data. This generated eight strata. Then, we sorted schools within each stratum by performance on the schools’ 2013 first grade reading end of grade test scores. We then created triplets of schools with similar test scores within each stratum. For example, the three schools with the best scores in the group of low exposure schools in Lempira would be one triplet, the next three schools would be another triplet, and so forth. In addition to improving balance across the three experimental groups on geographic areas, baseline exposure, and baseline performance, this approach is expected to improve the precision of our estimates.","Differences in average outcomes will represent unbiased estimates of the interventions’ impacts on outcomes. Here, we present an example of how we will measure impacts on the final outcome of student learning. The regression model will control for chance differences between treatment groups in schools’, teachers’, or students’ baseline characteristics. These will include schools’ EOG reading scores at baseline, teachers’ participation in training on assessment at baseline, teachers’ use of assessment at baseline, and other variables. Including covariates in our regression model will allow us to increase the statistical power of the study. We will also include dichotomous variables for the strata used in random assignment. For each outcome we analyze, the model can be expressed as follows:

where y_ist is the outcome of interest (such as reading or math test score) for student i in school s at time t; t will take on values of 0, 1 or 2, we will evaluate the equation above after one (t = 1) and two (t = 2) years of implementation, controlling for baseline (t = 0) characteristics, and we will include dummy variables for the r strata used in random assignment, as represented by alpha. The vector xis0 represents the baseline characteristics of student i in school s, which may include age, gender, and baseline reading measures y, if available. The vector zs0 represents the baseline characteristics of the school s, such as school size, whether teachers teach multiple grades at once, or school-level baseline reading or math test scores measures y. The variables TAs and TCs are indicators equal to one for students in schools assigned the intervention A or C, respectively, and zero otherwise. The term eta_s is a school-specific error term (a group or cluster effect); epsilon_ist is a random error term for student i in school s observed at time t. The parameters lambdaA and lambdaC represent the impact of the FA and EOG interventions for the A versus B comparison and the negative of the impact of the EOG intervention for the B versus C comparison, respectively. Therefore, we will test the restriction that lambdaA = 0 and also test lambdaC = 0. We will also test whether there is a significant difference between intervention groups A and C by testing the restriction that lambdaA = lambdaC. 
After collecting midline data, we will determine whether there is a meaningful difference in implementation between groups A and B. EducAcción staff will not provide group B schools training or materials in support of the use of FA, but teachers in group B schools may choose to increase their use of FA on their own as a strategy to respond to their EOG test results. If this is common, there will not be a meaningful difference between the intervention implemented in group A and B schools. If this occurs, we will test the difference between outcomes of schools in either group A or B to outcomes of schools in group C. In other words, we will substitute lambdaAB (representing being in A or B) for lambdaA and lambdaB, and test the hypothesis that lambdaAB = 0. We will make this determination before analyzing the final outcome data.

","The minimum detectable effect size (MDES) calculations presented here focus on test score outcomes because learning is the primary outcome of interest for the evaluation. We use existing end-of-grade (EOG) test score data from 2012 to calculate EOG test score standard deviations and intracluster correlations for the areas where the intervention will take place.

The main inputs for the MDES calculations are: (1) the percentage of variance explained by the use of covariates in the regression model (R2) is assumed to be 0.1 for schools and 0.5 for students; and (2) the intracluster correlation, which is a measure of the similarity of students between schools versus the total between- and within-school variation, is estimated to be 0.06 based on 2012 EOG reading scores. These calculations also assume 80 percent power, statistical significance at the 5 percent level, and a two-tailed test.

We will compare each of two treatment groups to a third reference group. For this type of comparison, the Dunnett test is the most appropriate test to control Type I error across multiple contrasts. Therefore, we assume that a Dunnett test will be used in the three comparisons studied. 
Assuming a sample of 180 schools, we will have a student sample of 1,800 students, or 10 students per school.

","The evaluation design will be based on a cluster randomized trial in which a target sample of 192  villages with the selected facilitators/educators will be allocated randomly to intervention variants 1 to 3 described above and a control group.  In total, there will be 48 villages in each intervention arm, including the control. 

Within each village we intend to treat and collect data on all children aged 7-16 months at the start of the intervention. We estimated an average of 7.5 children in this age group per community based on data from our sanitation project in similar villages. However, in our final sample of 192 villages, this average was around 14. Since our budget did not allow for treatment of so many more children, we adopted the following approach: 
      - In villages with 8 children or less (one third of the 192 villages), we took all children to be part of the study. 
     - In the remaining villages, we chose one eligible child at random and thereafter included in the sample those additional seven children that live geographically speaking closest to the randomly chosen child.
This approach ensures that even in villages with relatively large populations and spread, our target children would come from the same neighbourhood, hence facilitating intervention implementation. Similarly, it allows to have a clear criteria for inclusion into (exclusion out of) the intervention. On the one hand, we have a clear age cut-off, on the other hand a geographical clustering. It may also improve the quality of the intervention if all mothers of children in a particular age group in the villages interact and provide social support for each other regarding child-rearing practices. Finally, this will be consistent with scaling-up the program to full coverage.
Villages are randomised to the different intervention arms as we expect the interventions to have spillover within villages. By randomizing across villages we allow for possible spillovers within villages that may increase the overall impacts.  
Indeed part of our evaluation design is to measure such spillovers, which if there may be an important conduit for propagating and reinforcing good practice in child rearing. To do so, we will in addition to our target children, interview households of mothers with children below and above the target age range (2-6 months and 17-20 months). In total, 767 such spillover-households will be included in the sample.
To summarize, the total sample sizes will be 1,451 families with children in the 7-16 month age range at project start and 767 children outside the treatment age range, distributed among three groups of 48 intervention villages and one group of 48 control villages.

We have also assumed perfect compliance, which is what we hope to come close to. However, note that a small degree of non-compliance will not hurt power much, which is more sensitive to the number of clusters/communities than to the number of individuals within the cluster. We will make every effort to avoid non-compliance so as to avoid introducing any bias. On this basis and our study design, we will be able to detect improvements larger than 21%-32% of a standard score (for cognition or other similar outcomes – for boys and girls taken together) for any pairwise comparison with the control. For each gender separately the minimum detectable effect lies between 28% and 36% of a standard score.
We have presented MDEs on the basis of a low spatial correlation (0.04), which is the number we found in the rural communities of Colombia (where members of the team implemented a home-visiting intervention) and on the basis of a relatively high spatial correlation of 0.3. Moreover, we have not taken into account that in estimating the impacts we will include baseline variables in the regressions, which can reduce the noise substantially and therefore increase precision. Thus, we view the minimum detectable effects as an upper bound of what we will achieve: in practice we expect to be able to detect even smaller effects.

It has been argued, however, that the introduction of these policies in China in 1997 has not helped fighting corruption. Consistent with this view, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party passed on 23 October 2014 a Decision concerning Several Major Issues in Comprehensively Advancing Governance According to Law which stressed the current government’s strong commitment to fight corruption introducing heavier penalties but also severe restrictions of leniency offered to bribe-givers. Claims on the effects of the 1997 reform are not backed by data, to our knowledge, while evaluating the effects of a policy on crimes like corruption is difficult. These crimes are typically only observed if detected and convicted by the police, and an increase in observed convictions may as well be due to an increase in the total number of crimes rather than to a positive effect of the policy. We collected data on the investigations of bribery and public official corruption, available for most Chinese provinces for the period 1986-2010. The available evidence so far points to a substantial and stable reduction in the number of major corruption cases around the 1997 reform, a result per se ambiguous but consistent with a positive deterrence effect of the 1997 reform. Here we describe the planned case study analysis under way to corroborate and help the interpretation of these preliminary findings.",2015-08-01,2015-11-30,"Relative incidence of harassment bribes in the total. Looking at the prosecution documents we can first of all form a better idea of whether the presence of improper benefit is actually considered in practice, and so whether harassment bribes are effectively set apart and subject to a different discipline (in particular, the exemption from punishment for the giver). Further, if this is the case, we can observe whether the 1997 reform led to a change in this respect, and hence on the frequency of harassment bribes relative to other types of bribery among the cases detected.

Relative incidence of report by the bribe-giver. Ideally we would want to know whether the case was initiated by a spontaneous report, at least for harassment bribes: after the introduction of asymmetric punishment, we should in general expect a higher frequency of cases in which the (no longer guilty) bribe-givers come forth and report the crime to the authorities. For the other class of bribes, the introduction of leniency can have an ambiguous effect. Among other things this will depend on the severity of sanctions and the actual likelihood of obtaining leniency. Unfortunately the information on how the case was initiated is not available in the case files. There is however some indication of whether the defendant volunteered information if leniency was awarded.

Size of the bribe, size of the return, income or status of the bribe-giver (and the bribe-taker) If the reform, through the introduction of leniency and asymmetric punishment, makes detection easier because of the incentives provided to the bribe-giver, this amounts to an increase in the expected fine for the bribe-taker (even though the actual sanctions decrease). We expect this to lead to an increase of bribe size for distortionary bribes: the threshold to undertake corrupt behavior is now raised, hence individuals will only exchange bribes if the returns from this corrupt agreement are higher. The picture is different though for harassment bribes, when the bribe-giver is not expected to give back the gain. In this case incentives to report increase with the size of the bribe, so the larger bribes will be deterred to a larger extent.","","We select a sample of prosecution case files to be read and analyzed in detail. The total number is determined by a power calculation.

We propose four treatment arms (see the table below). As described in detail below, the different arms vary in the extent of participation by school officials and other local meals providers (most commonly self-help groups).

Treatment Arms:

T0         Control. Standard midday meal scheme with no additional intervention

T1A      Centralized midday meal scheme (unfortified). The centralized kitchen model was designed by Naandi to minimize costs and provide uniform meals. The model is also designed to prevent individual meal providers from pocketing funds.

T2      Standard midday meal scheme with fortification.

In these power calculations, we first focus on power to detect differences between a treatment arm and the control schools (where we expect zero take-up). We calculate a minimum detectable effect (MDE) of 2.19 mg/kg for zinc and 25.13 mcg/100g for vitamin A. These calculations assume an intra-cluster correlation of 0.2 and a standard deviation of 6.18 mg/kg for zinc and 70.91 mcg/100g for vitamin A. We estimated these standard deviations by collecting 2 food samples each from 4 schools, fortifying one of each pair with the mix and sending all 8 samples for laboratory testing. This exercise also gave us a sense of the difference in the amount of zinc and vitamin A we should expect between a fortified meal and an unfortified meal: The mean difference in nutrient content between the fortified samples and the non-fortified samples was 61.14 mg/kg for zinc and 219.43 mcg/100g for vitamin A, 95% and 46% of the amount of each nutrient in the mix. However, we have since changed the mix due to pressure from the government; with the new mix, we expect an effect of approximately 37 mg/kg for zinc and 107 mcg/100g for vitamin A, respectively. With 100% take-up, the MDE is still substantially below the expected effect size. In fact, we would be able to detect a significant difference in zinc content even if take-up was as low as 6% and in vitamin A content if take-up was as low as 24%. Based on our previous experience with the schools during the pilot, we expect much higher levels of take-up.

We next test whether we have sufficient power to detect differences between multiple treatment arms. Here we assumed a higher standard deviation based on our pilot test results. With this higher variation, we should be able to detect a 4.35 mg/kg difference in zinc content and 50.25 mcg/100g in vitamin A if the difference in take-up was 100%. This large difference in take-up is unlikely, but we should still be able to detect a difference as long as the difference in take-up is higher than 12 percentage points for zinc and 47 percentage points for vitamin A.

B.	Power to Detect Differences in Haemoglobin
We next turn to our ability to detect differences in haemoglobin. With a sample size of approximately 14 students per school surveyed, our MDE (Intention to Treat) is approximately 0.20 g/dL. Even with a take-up rate of 50% (during our pilot interventions we experienced even higher take-up rates), we can detect an effect (Treatment on the Treated) of 0.40 g/dL. Due to financing constraints, we may have to reduce our endline sample to 10.5 surveyed students per school; in this event, our MDE (Intention to Treat) will be approximately 0.22 g/dL. Even with a take-up rate of 50%, we will be able to detect an effect (Treatment on the Treated) of 0.44 g/dL. We compared our MDE to expected effect sizes we drew from the literature, specifically, from two studies that looked at the impact of providing a micronutrient mix that did not contain iron (Fawzi et al. 2007 and Mehta et al. 2011). The mean effect size across the two studies was 0.62 g/dL, higher than our MDE estimates.

Our partner, Sanergy has created a network of hygienic latrines in Nairobi. However, as with many other technical solutions to a range of development problems, widespread adoption of this “clean toilet” option has been a challenge. Barriers such as distance, cost, long queues, or lack of understanding of health risks may preclude individuals from choosing the sanitation option that may be better from a public health point of view. We also hypothesize that behaviors like open defecation may persist because they represent ingrained habits that are difficult to change. Inspired by findings from psychology and neuroscience, we propose field experiments that are designed to instill a revised habit of community toilet use among the slum population of Nairobi. Habit loops have been successfully created by private sector firms to increase demand for many household products and behaviors such as brushing regularly with Pepsodent toothpaste, or spraying Febreze air freshener. We propose to create such a loop for Sanergy toilets using a combination of economic incentives and a marketing campaign that is attentive to psychological cues and rewards. The experiments are designed to separate habit formation from other closely related models of risk aversion and learning.

Unfortunately, participation in these campaigns is often low, undermining the effectiveness of proven interventions. The dangers of low participation are particularly acute when threshold levels of coverage are needed to prevent disease, as a in vaccination or vector control campaigns. New approaches are needed to understand and influence household decisions to participate in door-to-door public health interventions. In this study, we apply novel basic science discoveries from behavioral economics to increase participation in an ongoing Chagas disease vector control campaign in Arequipa, Peru, where we have collaborated with the Ministry of Health for a decade. Low participation currently threatens the success of the campaign; the greatest barriers to participation reported by household include lost work hours, concerns about insecticide, and allergies. The overarching hypothesis of our study is that low rates of participation in door-to-door vector control campaigns can be significantly improved through interventions that incorporate the realities of human decision-making and behavior change. Recent insights from the field of behavioral economics suggest that common cognitive biases and mental shortcuts- such as present bias and following social norms- contribute to low participation in vector control campaigns, as they do in other domains. Through new formative work, we identified three interventions with high potential to overcome these biases and thereby increase participation: responsive scheduling with advance commitment, neighbor recruitment, and contingent group lotteries. The core of our proposed study is a cluster-randomized field trial to evaluate the impact of these three interventions. We first determine the rate of participation under each intervention, and then measure the programmatic and participant costs associated with each, to assess comparative cost-effectiveness. In addition, to address concerns about whether behavioral economic interventions lead to motivation crowd out- when extrinsic motivation for healthy behaviors reduces intrinsic motivation- we assess whether exposure to these interventions is correlated with decreased household participation in three subsequent health campaigns. The development, refinement, and scale-up of our interventions will yield evidence-based practices that can increase the impact of health promotion and disease prevention efforts in the United States and globally.",2015-03-16,2015-10-30,"Household participation in the vector control campaign.

","Randomized field trial: This is a cluster-randomized field trial of three novel interventions and the current campaign as the control.

All households in sampled sectors will be included in the trial. Non-participation in the preliminary survey does not preclude inclusion in the sampling frame.","We will calculate the Mahalanobis distance among clusters based on infestation and participation in the previous spraying campaign (6 months before). We will use datasets from previous spraying campaigns in the city of Arequipa to build a logistic regression model and estimate the impact of infestation in the previous campaign and participation on the previous campaign on participation on a subsequent campaign. We will use the exponentiated coefficients from this model to give different weights to the variables for the estimation of the distances between observations. To balance these two confounding variables (infestation and previous participation), we will divide the geographical clusters in 4 blocks based on the estimated Mahalanobis distance between observations. Finally, we will randomly assign clusters from each block to one of the four intervention arms.",Clusters of approximately 100 households,56 clusters of 100 households/cluster ,"5,600 households","1,400 households control, 1,400 households contingent group lottery, 1,400 responsive scheduling with advanced commitment, and 1,400 neighbor recruitment.",We use the method of Blitstein et al. to calculate power and sample size for the cluster randomized trial. Our cluster-randomized trial is powered for a head-to-head comparison of the four arms of the trial. All calculations use the Bonferonni correction to account for the six possible comparisons between all pairs of arms; we derived the expected intracluster correlation coefficient parameter (0.02) from our existing data from the most recent campaign in Mariano Melgar district. We selected our sample size based on the lower bound of participation. The power of our trial depends on the participation achieved under the alternative arms. We are powered at 88.5% to detect an increase of 11% over the level of participation achieved in a previously treated district (66%); anything less would not justify the effort and costs of the interventions.

During this process we will be able to assess in which way the educational dimensions of “mastery experience” and “vicarious learning” influence the entrepreneurial self-efficacy of young pupils as well as their inclination to participate in high-growth oriented entrepreneurial activities.

3000 randomly selected pupils (year of birth = 2000) will be randomly divided into three groups and invited to participate in three different online-based educational programmes all of which will last for two weeks. In order to test the effectiveness of practice-based and experiential entrepreneurship education one group will be requested to perform weekly challenges and reflect on how they have been affected by the activities which they have performed and on the type of learning that they perceive to have gained from these challenges. This group will be compared to pupils who will be asked to view and reflect on two weekly presentations by entrepreneurial role models. Both of these groups will be compared to a control group of pupils who will only be requested to view and reflect on two short scientific documentaries each week. The goal of the experiment is to analyse how we can best use online-based education in order to influence pupils at an early stage of education to make them consider entrepreneurship as an attractive career choice.",2015-11-02,2015-11-16,"According to social learning theory, the most powerful way to motivate individuals to engage in a specific activity is to increase their confidence in performing the various tasks that are required in order to execute these activities successfully, that is, their task-specific self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977a,b, 1997). An individual’s level of self-efficacy is, according to Bandura (1997), easiest to influence by either providing the individual with mastery experiences or through vicarious learning.
Vicarious learning, or modelling as it is often called, can effectively be provided by role models. Students may learn how to perform specific skillsets and how to execute specific activities by observing role models. This learning is, however, not solely instrumental. Role models may also affect whether or not the specific behaviour is perceived as desirable and thereby motivate or demotivate the students to engage in the behaviour. However, in order to get a mastery experience it is not enough to only listen to role models, it is necessary to practise the particular behaviour. By getting challenges that increase in complexity in a step-wise manner, the pupils will be increasingly acquainted with the behaviour and will increase their confidence in performing the different tasks that are involved in this behaviour.
We thus expect that both of these educational approaches will have positive effects, however in slightly different ways and on different variables. Compared to the control group both educational programmes will have a significantly higher positive influence on the pupils’ entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions.
H1a: The entrepreneurship programmes will have a positive effect on the pupils’ level of entrepreneurial attitudes and entrepreneurial intentions.

Practical experience with a behaviour does, however, tend to have a sticky effect on the practitioners’ perception of the specific behaviour (Biggs & Tang, 2007; Illeris, 2009). We therefore expect the influence of the experiential programme on its participants’ entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions to remain one year after their participation, whereas this effect will wear off for participants in the role model programme.
H2a: The influence which the experiential programme has on its participants’ entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions will not be significantly different one year after their participation (endline) compared to immediately after their participation in the programme (follow-up).
H2b: The level of entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions for participants in the role model programmes will not be significantly different at baseline and endline.

We furthermore expect that the role model programme will not have any significant effect on the pupils’ entrepreneurial self-efficacy since it typically requires practice to learn skills (Biggs & Tang, 2007). We therefore only anticipate the experiential programmes to have a significantly positive effect on the pupils’ entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Naturally, this effect may in time wear of, but we do expect it to be still significantly higher one year after the completion of the programme compared to the pupils’ baseline levels.
H3a: Participants in the experiential programme will have significantly higher levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy after they completed the programme.
H3b: Participants in the experiential programme will have significantly higher levels of ESE one year after they completed the programme.",See above,"3000 randomly selected Danish adoloscents born in 2000 (14-15 years old) will be invited to participate in a survey and in addition to this they will be invited to participate in a two week long online-programme.

Six hundred schools were randomly selected from the universe of public upper primary schools in the Dominican Republic. These 600 schools were then randomly assigned to one of three groups:
T1: Persuasive videos (200 schools)
T2: Informative videos (200 schools)
C: No videos (200 schools) 

Randomization was conducted by grouping schools into rural/urban status and region (north, southeast, and southwest). Within each of these 6 groups, one school was randomly selected. Based on the predicted dropout rate of that school, two additional schools with the closest predicted dropout within the group were selected. Randomization into T1, T2, and C groups was conducted within these triplets. 
The type of informative poster (either men’s or women’s earnings information) was randomly assigned across the 200 schools in T2.

Since many of the effects we are interested in estimating require receipt of stage 1 reminders, we will allocate only 20 percent of the sample to ""no reminders"". Since the randomization will be conducted at the individual level, we have used the minimum detectable effect formula without clustering in Glennerster and Takavarasha (2013). We have calculated the sample size needed to achieve target power for a single survey round (i.e. assuming one observation per individual) since we wish to estimate short- and long-run impacts separately. We have also scaled up our sample sizes to account for an assumed 10 percent attrition rate. This calculation suggests that we need a total sample size of 3,243, which we have rounded up to 3,500 for budgeting purposes and to account for the fact that some individuals in the first-stage reminder group will need to be used to pilot the BDM mechanism.

This design implies that we have sufficient power to detect a 0.12 standardized effect size between price and information arms, a 0.15 standardized effect size between ""no reminders"" and ""first-stage reminders"", and a 0.14 standardized effect size in terms of the impact of information treatments on willingness-to-pay for reminders. We are also interested in estimating reminder treatment effects conditional on a zero-to-negative willingness-to-pay. We have reasonable power to detect treatment effects when just 20-30 percent of individuals do not positively value reminders. To put these numbers in context, assuming a 50 percent adherence rate in the control group, a 0.2 standardized effect size amounts to a minimum detectable effect of 10 percentage points in terms of adherence"
Credit with health education in Benin: A cluster randomized trial examining impacts on knowledge and behavior,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/726,"October 06, 2015",2015-06-01 16:08:52 -0400,AEARCTR-0000726,"Dean Karlan, dean.karlan@yale.edu",completed,2007-10-01,2010-03-01,"[""education"", ""finance"", ""health"", """"]","","Background: 
We evaluate whether health education integrated into microcredit lending groups reduces health risks by improving health knowledge and behaviors among urban and rural borrowers in eastern Benin. 

Methods:
In 2007, we randomly assigned 138 villages in the Plateau region of Benin to one of four variations of a group liability credit product, varying lending groups’ gender-composition and/or inclusion of health education using a 2x2 design. Groups 1 (female-only) and 2 (mixed-gender) included health education on malaria, childhood illness danger signs, and HIV/AIDS. Groups 3 (female-only) and 4 (mixed-gender) received the credit product without health education. In 2010, a follow-up survey in 121 of 138 villages (n=3,625) interviewed a random sample of women living near each village meeting site to measure respondents’ knowledge of malaria, childhood illness, and HIV/AIDS; prevention and treatment behaviors; and empowerment and social capital. We estimate treatment effects on indices of key outcome variables using ordinary least squares.

Findings:
Women in villages receiving health education showed improved knowledge of malaria and of HIV/AIDS, but not of childhood illness danger signs. No significant changes in health behavior were observed except an increase in HIV/AIDS prevention behavior, a result predominantly driven by an increase in respondents’ self-reported ability to procure a condom, likely an indicator of increased perceived access rather than improved preventative behavior. Women in villages assigned to mixed-gender groups had significantly lower levels of social capital, compared to villages assigned to female-only groups.

Interpretation:
Bundling health education with microcredit may not be an effective way to improve health behavior.

The program aims to reduce both morbidity and mortality, particularly for children under five. The key behaviors that C4D attempts to influence are: (i) Exclusive breast feeding for the first six months and complementary feeding up to age 2; (ii) Hand washing with soap at key times (before and after cleaning a baby, before preparing food, and after defecating); (iii)Malaria prevention by sleeping under an insecticide treated net; (iv) Diarrhea treatment, specifically the importance of using ORS; and (v) Birth delivery by a skilled attendant.

The C4D program includes three complementary interventions: counseling and community outreach by Community Based Agents (CBAs), community dramas, and community radio broadcasts.  In addition, a Mobile for Development (M4D) campaign is currently being implemented, to further support and complement the basic C4D interventions. The M4D intervention delivers key health messages on the same five behaviors via pre-recorded voice messages. Beneficiaries receives two messages per week for 24 weeks.

Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is evaluating the impact of the C4D program. In 2012, IPA conducted a baseline survey of 4320 respondents (mothers with children under the age of five) in 216 communities. For the C4D program, 108 communities were randomly selected. Within these 108 communities, 20 households per community were randomly selected to be surveyed. A midline survey was conducted from July-September 2014, and an endline survey will be conducted at the end of the program. 

In addition to the community-based interventions, approximately 2000 mothers were chosen for an individual level mobile phone intervention (M4D). The eligibility requirements for the M4D intervention included: (i) phone ownership or access to a phone through a family member living in the same household, and (ii) mothers with children under the age of five.Eligible mothers were randomly selected to either receive messages from the same speaker, or to receive messages from different speakers from their own area. Mobile voice messages were developed to cover the same five behaviors outlined above.

The government has passed regulations to protect hake, such as a ban on fishing and consumption during September, when the hake reproduces, but have faced challenges in enforcing regulations effectively. This project seeks to experimentally evaluate the impact of two complementary interventions that aim to reduce the over capture of hake fish during its ban period: (1) Informing vendors about the ban and penalizing those that sell illegal fish during September and (2) a consumer information campaign designed to sensitize them about this environmental problem and discourage the consumption of hake during the ban.",2015-09-05,2015-09-30,"The supply side interventions aim to study vendors’ reaction to enforcement and information campaign, concretely we are interested on studying the effects in the sale of hake and its substitutes during the ban period. Additionally, we are interested in collecting information regarding the adjustment on vendors' illegal behavior, as a reaction to government’s enforcement. 

The specific context in which the vendor sells fish may generate relevant consequences on the treatment effects, we are particularly interested in studying closely the treatment effect in some subgroups. For example, we are interested in comparing the treatment effect of vendors located in geographically isolated areas, with vendors located in more concentrated areas - where they face more competitive pressures. Also, we will estimate the treatment effect of those vendors located near the coast, since they buy fish directly from fishermen while the ones located in interior regions buy from intermediate fish dealers.

Regarding the demand side intervention, we aim to study the consumer reaction to the information campaign, as well as the reaction of fish vendors to fluctuations in the fish demand. Particularly, we are interested in studying whether informed consumers change the fish consumption behavior; substituting the hake fish by other fish or product. Additionally, through variations in the proportion of the distribution of information within districts, we would like to elucidate the existence of spill overs in the behavior in control consumers.","","The supply side interventions were assigned at market level, it considered 153 local markets, where we distributed two treatments:

In many cases, citizens have little information on the quality of the health services that are actually being provided and almost no basis of comparing what they can observe with what they are supposed to be receiving.  They also have little sense of what they might do with the information they may have to improve the quality of local health service delivery.  Furthermore, frontline health providers themselves may have little sense of how their performance, and the health of the community they serve, compares to that of other health facilities and communities.

This project constitutes a scaled up replication of the “Power to the People” intervention (Björkman and Svensson, 2009; henceforth P2P).  P2P collected information about health delivery in local health facilities, distributed this information to citizens and frontline providers in a report card, mobilized citizens and providers in light of this information, and organized meetings in which citizens and providers could jointly discuss how to improve health outcomes in the community.  The study reported striking impacts on infant weights, under-5 mortality, community engagement, and other outcomes.  Given these extremely large reported effects, there has been strong interest in testing whether the P2P findings replicate at a larger scale.

The present study employs a factorial design to replicate P2P and also break its complex treatment into two of its principal components: 1) the provision of information about health delivery quality to citizens and clinic staff and the mobilization of these actors in light of this information and 2) the holding of interface meetings between community members and clinic staff in which the action plans they each develop can be discussed and coordinated.  377 health facilities (and associated catchment areas) are randomized to receive each part of the treatment (or, in some cases, both together, as in P2P).

This project tests two financial education curricula for primary school students. Specifically, it measures the impact of financial education on student behavior attitudes, and outcomes. 

The evaluation was conducted over the course of one school year, from September 2010 to August 2011, in partnership with Aflatoun, a Dutch NGO providing social and financial education to children in 33 countries.

The study included 5,000 primary school students aged 9 - 14 in 135 public schools in semi-urban and rural Ghana, including 30 schools in Greater Accra, 60 in Volta, and 45 in Western District. One-third of the schools in each region were randomly assigned to each of three different groups: the Aflatoun program, Honest Money Box (HMB) intervention, or a comparison group without treatment. The Aflatoun curriculum includes lessons about planning, budgeting, saving, proper spending, as well as self-esteem building exercises. The HMB intervention, in contrast, is solely focused on financial education and is designed to provide a comparison for Aflatoun’s social curriculum.

This initiative aimed to identify and evaluate promising ideas to improve life outcomes of youth at elevated risk for violence involvement. The winning proposal in the Chicago Design Competition was a collaborative program developed by Children’s Home + Aid and Youth Advocate Programs. These organizations have have received funding to work with youth at high risk of violence involvement on the South Side of Chicago. The Crime Lab will evaluate this promising intervention that combines Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Wraparound Services that will be delivered to 440 at-risk youth during 2015-2017. Because there is little definitive evidence on the effectiveness of intensive services programs for high-risk youth, identifying programs that are successful with this population is a key policy priority for the Mayor’s Office and other key stakeholders in Chicago. 

",2015-10-09,2016-07-31,"The two year evaluation of the Children’s Home + Aid and Youth Advocate Programs trauma-informed youth advocate collaboration will seek to address the following questions:

Education Outcomes
1. Does the TF-CBT/Wraparound model increase connection to school for treatment youth? 
2. Does the TF-CBT/Wraparound model reduce in-school disciplinary infractions for treatment youth? 
3. Does the TF-CBT/Wraparound model improve GPA among treatment youth? Test scores? 

Crime Outcomes 
1. Does the TF-CBT/Wraparound model reduce out of school arrests for treatment youth? Non-violent vs. violent crimes? Victimization vs. perpetrator? 

","""Connection to school"" will be measured by attendance, activity involvement (such as extracurricular activities), and the CPS ""on track"" indicator","Randomized Controlled Trial:
For each program cohort of 110, the youth will be randomly selected from a list of at least 220 eligible youth. The Crime Lab will compare the treatment group outcomes to the control group outcomes, looking specifically at arrests and victimization, connection to school or employment, and academic performance. Given the structure of the referrals and the background of our youth, we will stratify (or block) the sample to improve our treatment effect estimates. Randomization guarantees that our treatment and control groups will be similar in expectation, but stratifying helps ensure this actually occurs in practice with our sample of youth. 
","More detail on RCT:
The referral sources will provide the Crime Lab with a list of names, from which the Crime Lab will randomly select half to receive the program. The Crime Lab will share the list of selected youth with CHA and YAP, who will then contact and recruit the youth. This method ensures that no youth will be contacted with a potential offer of services that is then rescinded. There is a high need for these services, but because the program is intensive and expensive, CHA and YAP only have the capacity to provide the 5-month program to 110 youth at a time. This study design ensures a fair allocation of these limited services and does not restrict the control group from getting other services for which they would normally be eligible. 

We will stratify based on referral source. Stratifying according to some variables will improve the precision of our estimates to the extent that the referral source and gang affiliation of a youth helps explain variation in our treatment (Cox and Reid, 2000). This is possible given that the level of risk in engaging in violent behavior or disconnecting from school will differ by referral source. 


Social Network Analysis:
If the CHA/YAP intervention is successful at improving outcomes for high risk youth, we hypothesize that this will not only improve the lives of the youth that are directly touched by the program, but also have a ripple effect in their communities. We are adding a network analysis component to the planned evaluation in order to capture the diffusion or “spillover” of the intervention. Mapping entire social networks is labor intensive, but the “friendship paradox” can be used to quickly identify social links. Using this strategy, we will add two surveys to our planned evaluation. First, before service provision begins, youth in the study will be asked a series of network name-generating questions to identify their peers and associates. We will also use this survey to collect baseline data on youth exposure to violence and psychological health. At the end of the program, we will launch a second survey to gather data on outcomes for youth in the study as well as a randomly selected subset of members of the study youth’s previously identified social network. The outcome data collected through this survey would supplement data on academic and criminal behavior collected from the Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Police Department.  

Machine Learning:
Beyond the important policy question of the effectiveness of intensive support services, we believe this study could provide broader insight to the field in two key areas. First, little is known about how to effectively target programs to youth that are most likely to be perpetrators or victims of violence and those who are most likely to benefit from a high intensity intervention. By collecting information about how program referral agencies prioritize youth for services and examining which youth are most responsive to interventions, it is our hope that this study will provide guidance on how best to target high intensity interventions.",Randomization done by computer,Eligible youth were randomized at the individual level and stratified by referral source.,880 youth ,880 youth,"440 treatment youth, 440 control youth",""

We study the effectiveness of non-price instruments at promoting water conservation in the residential sector in Cape Town, South Africa's second largest city. Using inserts in monthly customer bills, we test nine behavioral messages (treatments) in a randomized control trial on 412,489 households. The treatments are classified into four groups: public-good framing (voluntary contributions to a common goal/good), financial framing (focusing on the financial losses/gains associated with inefficient/efficient water usage), social-comparison framing (where household consumption is compared to that of other households) and social-recognition framing (recognizing water conservation).   ",2015-11-06,2016-05-05,"Monthly water consumption (in kiloliters) at the household level. 
","
","The eligible population for this study is all residential households with access to piped water in the City of Cape Town. We are excluding commercial customers and only including those classified as “domestic” by the City. Furthermore, as we are limiting our sample to free standing houses, we are also excluding households with bulk meters. This obviates issues regarding flats where one meter number could be linked to multiple households. It further ensures that the recipient of the message is most likely one of the household members consuming water. 

We are excluding those customers consuming only in Tariff Block 1, as this is the lowest consumption band (6 kilolitres/month) and is supplied free by the City. These households are already consuming the lowest possible amount of water each month and thus we assume they are either the most vulnerable residents in the City of Cape Town or are not residing in the household on a full-time basis (i.e. holiday home). If they are the most vulnerable residents in Cape Town, we want to safeguard against messaging them as it may be unethical (i.e. hazardous) to ask the lowest income residents to consume less water. 

However, as we are interested in how different behavioural messages affect consumption across all income groups, we are including households with “indigent” status in the treatments - provided they are consuming above Tariff Block 1. Indigent households in Cape Town are those deemed most vulnerable and, according to the City’s policy, struggle to pay for public utilities. Given that those receiving an indigent grant receive varying levels of subsidization of utilities, or receive utilities free of charge, we chose not to include them in the financial incentives treatments (treatments 2, 3 and 4). We will not message them regarding financial savings as our code would significantly overestimate the financial savings associated with a reduction in water consumption.  
 
The sample size is the population of the City of Cape Town excluding commercial and bulk accounts, apartment flats, and those consuming only within Tariff Block 1. This is a total expected sample size of 412,480 households: 113,312 are indigent and 299,168 are not indigent residents. We stratify the sample on suburbs (676) and tariff blocks (6 total). This leads to a total of 3213 distinct stratas. Using the stratas, we randomize the sample in slightly unequal numbers. The uneven allocation is due to i) inability to use indigent sample in the financial message treatments; ii) inflating the social recognition treatments due to the inability to message those households which receive estimated readings in the first month of the treatment; iii) inflating all treatments to account for households with meter readings higher than 35 days and also allow for those who fall into tariff block 1 to drop from the treatment.

","","The randomization is done using Stata v13. First we create stratas across suburbs (676 total) and tariff blocks (6 total). This leads to a total of 3,213 distinct stratas. We generate random numbers to each household and then by strata create a rank of the random numbers.  Then we randomise on two subsets: indigent, and non-indigent.  By strata, we allocate the indigent sample equally across all six treatments and control.  For the non-indigent, we create groups by strata and allow unequal allocation across treatments to account for households that will drop if they are in tariff block 1, have a meter reading greater than 35 days, and have an estimated reading for the first month (for social recognition treatments).

","We used the most recent consumption data from November 2014 to April 2015 from the City of Cape Town’s municipal database to conduct our power calculations. For the power calculations. we chose to use the months for which our study will be conducted in order to allow for seasonality effects as consumption increases in the summer months.  

We matched the municipal data with the list of contract accounts we received from the City's printers. We removed those consuming 6 kiloliters/month or below, as well as the 95th percentile to control for outliers due to measurement errors. We then calculated mean consumption over the treatment period last year (December-April).  

We include two power calculations: one where we look at the mean consumption over the treatment period with an unbalanced panel and one where we use the balanced panel. 

I) With our sample size, we are able to detect a 1.5% change in means per treatment. Assuming our standard deviation is 11.08, our mean is 21.47 kiloliters/month, alpha level is 0.05 and power of .8, the 1.5% detectable difference in means would be able to pick up an effect if the consumption decreases to 21.15 kiloliters/month (a difference of 0.32 kiloliters/month) with a minimum sample size of  18,579 per arm.  We have tried various strategies for the power calculations, yet the strategy is not sensitive to changes in the detectable effect size. 

We assume there will be high variability in the effect size across income groups. We will use property values and suburb as covariates in our regression models to decrease the variance.  

II) Our power calculations are robust when using the balanced sample (those whose consumption we observe in each month)

With our sample size, we are able to detect a 1.5% change in means per treatment. Assuming our standard deviation is 9.5, our mean is 21.1 kiloliters/month, alpha level is 0.05 and power of .8, a 1.5% detectable difference in means would be able to pick up an effect if the consumption decreases to 20.8 kiloliters/month (a difference of 0.31 kiloliters/month) with a sample size of  14,104 households per arm.

The PIRs provide health facilities with detailed information on their performance on four key reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health indicators relative to other facilities and relative to their past performance.  Using a randomized control experimental design and targeting approximately 1,400 facilities, this project aims to test the impact of increased transparency through the sharing of performance indicator reports with front line health workers on facility-level performance after 12 months.  Simultaneously, we plan to evaluate the impact of also sharing similar performance reports with district health officials in a random sample of about half of 95 districts in the country.  The goal is to shed light on the ways in which strengthening accountability chains in Uganda might help improve health system performance.",2015-10-21,2016-10-31,"The key outcome variables of interest are increases in the utilization of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health services (RMNCH) as measured by data in the HMIS system.

In addition, we will also use actual reporting rates as an outcome variable.

In addition to the outcomes in the HMIS system, we will conduct an endline facility survey to get a more comprehensive measure of overall health facility quality in a random sample of 30% of the health facilities in 50% of the districts.

The process of creating, disseminating and studying the impact of performance indicator reports is detailed below.

a. Facilities submit a monthly outpatient report on paper called HMIS 105. This report is sent to a technical officer who enters the data into DHIS2. 
b. We downloaded data for every Health Center Level II and III in 95 districts, at the 1,417 health facilities. From this data, we will generate performance indicator reports for each facility selected to participate. These reports will be based on four key indicators:
      i.	Number of 1st antenatal care visits, number of 4th antenatal care visits, number of deliveries and number of PCV3 vaccines administered.
c. The 95 districts were first divided into two randomly selected groups, 47 treatment districts and 48 control districts. Then the 1,417 facilities were divided into 708 treatment and 709 control facilities.
      i.	In Treatment districts, District Health Teams will receive summary reports by mTrac SMS messages monthly and in email form monthly as well. The report sent to the district will be supplemented with a ranking of facilities, highlighting top-performers. Note that all facilities in treatment districts are included in reports.
     ii.	In control districts, no report will be sent to the District Health Teams. Note that these control districts will contain facilities that have been sent facility indicator reports directly.
d. The facility-level treatment consists of facility-level indicator reports sent directly to directors or “in-charge” and data officers at selected facilities by SMS through the mTrac system.
     i.The report consists of a mean score of each chosen indicator as well as a measure of the frequency of reporting. The period of the report will cover a three month span to account for expected month to month fluctuations in service provision and the failure to report in a given month. Note that the report will be distributed monthly but is composed of the previous three months of data reported. In addition, the report will contain a comparison to performance during the same three month period 12-months before. Each indicator will be compared as well as an aggregate measure of change from the previous year. Last, the change from last year will be used to rank facilities of the same type within a given district. The facility receiving the report will learn where they stand in the district in addition to receiving the name of the facility immediately above and below their position.
e.Note that treatment facilities in this arm will be contained in districts in which district level health officials receive information about facilities (treatment districts) and also in districts where level health officials do not receive information about facilities (control districts). Similarly, control facilities that themselves do not receive performance indicator reports will be contained within some districts that receive reports about that facility. Purely control facilities will be facilities that do not receive performance indicator reports and are located within control districts.
f. For our analysis, we plan to study additional outcomes not contained in the performance indicator reports such as reporting rates, number of outpatient attendees, malaria treatment rates and stock of tracer medications, all of which will also be sourced from the HMIS system.
     i. To ensure reliability of the HMIS data, we will conduct facility level audits on a randomly selected subsample of facilities towards the end of the project. We estimate that 30% of facilities, roughly 100 facilities per treatment arm, will be audited. Our enumerators will ask the in-charge at the facility to view the facility’s records and record the data in addition to observing the condition of the facility at the time of the visit.

The selection process and criteria for each level are explained below.

First, districts containing the ACT Health project, administered by GOAL, were dropped from the sample due to close overlap between interventions. The remaining 95 eligible districts were randomly divided into treatment and control.
a. Districts were balanced on their total population and proportion of the population defined as ""rural"" by the 2014 Uganda Census. 
b. Districts were then blocked by region.

The facilities within the districts were randomly divided into treatment and control groups. Data to conduct the randomization was selected from the Uganda DHIS2 database using the following method:
a. Monthly submitted data for all government owned, functional health facilities level II and III was downloaded and analyzed.
b. The period of analysis extended from May 2014 to April 2015 with one observation per month per facility on each indicator. 
c. Four variables (ANC1, ANC4, deliveries and PCV3) were found to meet the selection criteria:
i. In line with MoH priorities for improvement
ii. Exists on current and future versions of HMIS reports
iii. Show low variance, as measured by a standard deviation close to the mean

This process provided 1,417 eligible facilities within the 95 sample districts. Facilities were balanced on the average number of reported antenatal care first and fourth visits as well as number of deliveries. Historical data for the entire 12 month period used for the randomization did not exist for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and this variable was omitted for the purpose of balance.

The power calculations were conducted with a sample of DHIS2 data and used the mean values and standard deviations of the primary outcome variables. An effect identified by the standard regression above that is larger than 0.2 σ from the mean will be reliably detected.

To power the study we conducted a simulation in Stata 13 using the command “factorial sim”. This allowed us to estimate the effect of the facility and district level interventions as well as the interaction effect between them. The study is sufficiently powered to detect an effect at the facility and district levels, however only a very small interaction effect can be detected.
 
Below are the probabilities that an effect of a given size will be detected. The effect sizes shown are our estimate of the potential effect of this intervention with the following key variables.

1)  The selection in the program of public works is made through public lotteries. In June 2013, the national roads agency (AGEROUTE) advertised the second wave of the PEJEDEC public works project in 16 localities throughout the country. 12,188 young people applied for the 3,125 positions available through the program. A public lottery was organized in each locality. The randomization was stratified by gender. It resulted in the formation of 125 brigades of 25 young people (each including 17 men and 8 women each). Young people were assigned to brigades within localities based on the number they drew in the public lottery. A waiting list of 5 people per brigade was also formed, in order to allow the replacements of drop-outs. In addition, a control group was composed of 1,035 randomly chosen non-selected youths (excluding the waiting list). 

2) The randomized allocation of brigades into two trainings (Entrepreneurship training or “Sensitization to Wage Employment/Job search skills training”) was made through a lottery organized in the project office with representatives from the implementing partner, AGEROUTE. The randomization was implemented by brigade, stratified by locality. Over the 125 brigades of the program, 40 brigades were randomly selected to beneficiate from Entrepreneurship training and 40 brigades were randomly selected to beneficiate from “Sensitization on Wage Employment / Job search skills training”. The 45 remaining brigades participated in the public works without receiving additional training.

A randomized double-blinded control trial of Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine Intermittent Preventive Treatment (SP-IPT) and Chloroquine Chemoprophylaxis in the prevention of malaria in pregnancy.,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/931,"October 30, 2015",2015-10-30 00:07:55 -0400,AEARCTR-0000931,"Idowu Ade-Ojo, ipadeojo@eksu.edu.ng",completed,2013-03-01,2014-03-01,"[""health"", """"]","","Malaria is a major public health problem in the sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization, Approximately 60% of the clinical cases of malaria and 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa, mostly in children under 5 years and pregnant women1,2. In addition to these acute disease and deaths, malaria also poses serious adverse outcome during pregnancy. It contributes significantly to maternal anaemia during pregnancy and adverse birth outcome such as abortions, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, intrauterine fetal death and stillborn3,4. All these add their own tolls to the unacceptable maternal and infant mortality and morbidity in Africa. Approximately 50 million women residing in high endemic malaria zone get pregnant annually5. About 25 – 30 million of these women are in sub-Saharan Africa with stable transmission of Plasmodium falciparum throughout the year6. 
In Nigeria, malaria accounts for about 60% of out-patient consultation and approximately 10,000 maternal death occur annually in the country due to malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum3,4, the commonest and the most fatal of the species of plasmodia causing malaria in West Africa. Similarly, 8 – 14 % of low birth weight and 3 – 8 % 0f all infant death in Nigeria are due to malaria infestation3.
Pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria particularly during the first and to a lesser extent during the second pregnancy. The suppression of cell-mediated immunity and the predilection of Plasmodium falciparum for Chondroitin Sulphate A (CSA) an adhesion molecule in the placental by means of parasite variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes is thought to explain why there is increased malaria infection in pregnancy, particularly in the primigravidae3,4,6. However, in multiparae, there is induced cytoadherence inhibiting VSA-CSA specific antibodies which confers on them some degree of resistance to placental parasitisation6.  This placental parasitisation which is a common occurrence with an increased frequency in the first pregnancy,  has been recognised as the most important factor that is responsible for most of the complications that occur in pregnancy due to malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized red blood cells in the placenta bed and intervillous spaces set the stage for inflammatory reaction with the release of mediators of inflammation that cause placental injury3,6. These pathological changes associated with heavy Plasmodium falciparum sequestered in the placenta bed leads to impaired fetomaternal blood flow that result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including abortion, low birth weight (LBW),  intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal anemia, congenital malaria and perinatal mortality2,4,6. Maternal mortality may result from complicated malaria or complication of anaemia due to malaria infection2,3. 
To prevent the adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy, the World Health Organization recommended weekly Chloroqiune as chemoprophylaxis for malaria in pregnancy7.  This was implemented to replace weekly Pyrimethamine whose effect had earlier been found not to be better than that of placebo. However, in the mid 1990s, because of poor patient compliance with prophylaxis and increasing resistance of parasite strains to chloroquine, WHO replaced weekly chloroquine prophylaxis as the drug based strategy for the prevention of malaria during pregnancy and has now been adopted by almost all malaria-endemic countries in Africa. Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine is now recommended for all pregnant women living in areas with stable malaria transmission8. Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine is given during antenatal visits at curative doses (1500mg Sulfadoine and 75mg Pyrimethamine) at least twice during pregnancy, first dose given in the second trimester after 16 weeks or after quickening. The second dose should be given at least one month after the first dose but not after 36 weeks of gestation to prevent the possibility of neonatal jaundice that can be associated with sulphonamide if given close to delivery2,5.

Intermittent Preventive Treatment with Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine has proven efficacious in reducing the incidence of pregnancy-associated malaria and is currently a component of the national malaria prevention program in Nigeria9. However, Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine efficacy for the treatment of symptomatic malaria in children has dwindled in the last 5 years raising concern about its longevity for IPT treatment10,11,12. Resistance to Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine results from mutation in the dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFR) and the dihydropteroate reductase (DHPS) genes of the parasite13,14. Though the in-vitro detection of the resistant gene has been increasing in Africa, the frequency of these mutations does not predict the efficacy of SP in the prevention of malaria in African children11,12. However, parasites with triple DHFR mutation have an approximately 1000 fold reduction in their susceptibility to pyrimethamine, which translates into a reduction in the duration of the suppressive prophylaxis thus compromising efficacy6,15. Countries with moderate to high levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance urgently require quidance on whether to continue using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for IPT during pregnancy. Thus, this drug may soon be compromised, and an urgent need exists to assess alternative drug regimens for intermittent preventive treatment.
Chloroquine was introduced into clinical practice in 194716 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria. It remained in the mainstream of malaria therapy for more than 50 years. Resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine16was first reported in the South-Asia and South America in the 1950s16. By the late 1970s16, the resistance had made its way into African continent when the resistance contributed to increased malaria transmissions and death. In 1993, Malawi was the first country in Africa to completely withdraw chloroquine and replaced it with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria15. For more than  10 years, chloroquine was not used anywhere in Malawi. At that time, the clinical efficacy of chloroquine was less than 50%. However, after 10 years of complete abandonment,the malaria parasite has once again become susceptible to chloroquine17,18,19. A recent study from Malawi showed that chloroquine was effective at treating malaria in 99 percent of the children, while sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was effective only in 21 percent20.  The molecular marker of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria subsequently declined in prevalence and was undetectable by 2001, suggesting that chloroquine might once again be effective in Malawi20. This remarkable switch in efficacy may not have occurred in Nigeria as well as many African nations because they have continued to use chloroquine even after officially switching to newer drugs to treat malaria.
The loss of the chloroquine to resistance was a public health catastrophe for Africa.  Chloroquine as an anti-malarial drug is inexpensive, rapid- and long-acting, and safe for all age groups and pregnant women. This prospective randomise-controlled double-blinded trial was therefore designed to ascertain whether chloroquine is still effective in preventing the adverse outcome of malaria during pregnancy in Nigeria.

First, we sample two groups of people: (A) villagers who deliberately opened a bank account, and (B) villagers who did not. The group B villagers are offered an account. Next, half the villagers of both group A and group B are randomly assigned to the second intervention: they receive weekly payments on their bank accounts. The other half (= control) receive the same amounts in cash. 

After 2-3 months of weekly payments, we measure trust levels and altruism towards bankers, as well as risk attitudes, using trust, dictator and risk games in a lab-in-the-field setting. This allows us to answer our research question, namely whether trust can be fostered by promoting the usage of accounts and the interactions between clients and their banker.",2014-02-24,2014-05-31,"detailed in attached pre-plan:

We interview these people on a weekly basis during 7 to 13 weeks, as to gather detailed information on the evolution of their household composition and the various earnings and expenditures of their household members. Because those surveys are extremely demanding, each participant is offered INR 150 after each interview.

The second treatment in the experiment is a randomization of the way the weekly compensation is paid. Half of the respondents with a BCSA account receive INR 150 directly on their account (treated), while the others receive it in cash (control). 

We now have 4 different groups: Ac had an account and is paid cash, Aa had an account and is paid on it, Bc just received an account and is paid cash, Ba just received an account and is paid on it. The comparison of the groups A and B is crucial to evaluate the importance of the initial self-selection. Most existing studies suffer from the caveat that they only observe impacts on the pool of self-selected individuals (corresponding to our group A). Those impacts may not be representative of what a large scale financial inclusion plan (with accounts opened for everyone) would achieve.

A few weeks after the last payment of Phase 1, we play games in the field to measure risk aversion, trust and altruism between the clients and the banker. The games are described in the attached pre-plan.

Demand for Aflatoxin-Tested Maize Flour in Kenya,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/947,"December 04, 2015",2015-12-04 09:37:09 -0500,AEARCTR-0000947,"Gloria Mbera, gmbera@poverty-action.org",on_going,2014-10-13,2016-01-31,"[""health"", """"]","","This research explores the nature and determinants of consumer demand for food safety in Kenya, in particular, demand for aflatoxin-tested maize. Consumption of high levels of aflatoxin can be fatal, and chronic exposure has been linked in numerous studies to liver cancer, suppressed immune response and child stunting. In Kenya, where maize is a staple in the diet, a significant proportion of maize and maize flour samples fail to meet regulatory standards, although these numbers can vary widely by year, season and region. One study by researchers with the CDC found that 65% of maize samples collected from 20 major millers did not meet the national standard (Gathura 2011) and a study using 2013 data found that 26% of maize flour samples were above this standard (Moser and Hoffmann 2015). Because aflatoxin is unobservable and regulatory standards are imperfectly enforced, even informed consumers cannot be confident of the safety of maize or maize flour available in the market.   Using a randomized controlled trial, we track the sales and prices of branded maize flour both before and after one of the brands becomes the first in Kenya to have its aflatoxin-testing procedures verified by a third party lab and to use a logo indicating this on its package.

We contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, consumer demand for food safety is not well understood.  Because modern regulatory systems keep unsafe food out of the market, consumers do not directly choose safety as an attribute in developed countries.  In markets where regulation is poorly in enforced or non-existent, consumers frequently do not have information on food safety.  Our project takes advantage of a unique opportunity to study an emerging food safety system in Kenya.  Commercial maize millers are beginning to respond to increasing consumer awareness of aflatoxin and pressure from the government by investing in aflatoxin testing.  A third-party verification program, which validates a mill's aflatoxin testing processes, recently became available to millers and provides millers a way to signal to consumers that their products are safe.

In terms of preventive health technologies in general, the evidence suggest that consumers' willingness to pay for such investments is low.  
Reasons likely include lack of awareness about the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of prevention measures, liquidity and credit constraints, present-biased time preferences, and attention constraints (Dupas, 2011; Spears, 2009; Kremer and Glennerster, 2011). However unlike other health investments that require discrete shifts in one’s use of time, attention or other scarce resources, households already purchase food; purchasing the brand that has been tested requires only a minor change in behavior. Further, the cost of purchasing safe food is a marginal increase to an unavoidable cash outlay; consumers are known to be less price sensitive to additional costs compared to stand-alone costs. Finally, food safety may be  perceived to be correlated with other food attributes, such as taste or consistent quality.  

Second, we contribute to the understanding of sustained behavior change.  Although a pilot study found a high willingness-to-pay for a one-time purchase of aflatoxin-tested maize, it may be that the introduction of tested maize constituted a temporary shock to the salience of aflatoxin as a health risk, and that demand for tested maize will fall as this salience fades. Consumers may also falsely believe that tested maize will be correlated with attributes such as improved taste, and revert to untested maize when this is found not to the case. While several studies test the impact of information on health behavior at a single point in time (Madajewicz et al, 2007; Jalan and Somanathan, 2008; Luoto 2009), we are not aware of work that characterizes the dynamic impact of information. Learning and limited attention models give different predictions about the dynamic impact of information on health behavior. A learning model predicts that information leads to permanent behavior change, whereas a limited attention model, in which information increases the salience of a particular health risk temporarily, predicts that the effect of information diminishes over time (DellaVigna, 2009).

4. Initial discount + marketing (12 shops)
5. Multiple discount + multiple marketing rounds (13 shops)

Once the mill began using the packages with the logo, all shops stocked the new packages, but in the control shops nothing was done to draw attention to the product change.  While it is not likely that consumers will notice the addition of the small logo on the packet or understand its significance, follow-up interviews will determine what consumers knew or noticed about the aflatoxin logo.","",In office by computer.,the shop,73 shops,"73 shops over more than 36 weeks of sales data.

While different theories can explain self-control problems, an important part of the literature focuses on “βδ” models of time-inconsistent preferences. In those models, individuals are assumed to be either (i) sophisticated, aware of their preferences, and taking commitment measures to protect their present-self from the behavior of their future-selves; or (ii) partially or fully naïve and ignoring the inconsistency in their preferences when deciding on their present consumption. 

Both theoretical and empirical studies alike have so far focused on the “forward looking” part of the consumers: how do they choose current and future consumption, given how much knowledge they have about their own preferences and the available commitment technologies. We on the other hand want to focus on another assumption that we believe is fundamental, but yet not researched. Naïve consumers are typically assumed to ignore not only their true future behavior, but also all their past decisions. The naïve consumer that makes time-inconsistent choices is assumed unable to look back at his past choices and infer from them the true shape of his preferences.

In Argentina, the government seeks to provide energy to the remaining electricity-deprived people in the country with the installation of green off-grid solutions in the form of solar home systems (SHSs). Due to low income levels of the beneficiary households, subsidies for both installation and maintenance are required. Subsidies puts constraints on government resources and jeopardizes the (financial) sustainability of the program.

Health insurance can address many of the health financing issues specially for the poor because a well designed and managed health insurance scheme can effectively deal with loss of efficiency and lack of equity associated with absence of such risk-pooling schemes. In this study, we attempt to understand the impacts of introducing a health security scheme that aims to insure low-skilled workers of a large semi-formal employer in Bangladesh. The scheme offers to cover for health care costs that can run up to twice as much the median monthly household income for the targeted beneficiar-ies. The scheme is mandatory for all the workers (including the low level manag-ers) with a nominal monthly premium collected from the workers with an equal contribution from the employer. The scheme will be introduced to randomly se-lected sub-centers, which employ the workers in groups of about 20 to 25. The random introduction will allow us to identify the impacts of the health insurance scheme on health seeking behavior, total and out-of-pocket expenditure and some labor market outcomes (such as workers’ absenteeism and productivity) as well as school attendance of the children who are also covered under the scheme. The evaluation will involve comparing before and after treatment information as well as cross-sectional analysis. Separate qualitative analyses will be carried out to inform both the researchers and implementation partners to come up with better and more innovative designs of the scheme in future.",2015-10-01,2016-03-31,"We will focus on the following sets of outcome variables:

(a) Health Care Seeking Behaviour, Utilization and Expenditure: Using both base line and follow-up surveys, we will measure the health care seeking behaviour (e.g., doctor visits or in-patient stay at hospitals) and expenditure. We will specially pay attention to out-of-pocket payments which are expected to decline because of the program.

(b) Mental Well-Being: The scope of participating in the health security scheme should provide the artisans with a buffer against substantial loss in savings (and possibly other income generating assets) that would be required by the household to meet the health care costs otherwise. This impact should be reflected in the artisan’s mental well-being. The research team will develop and implement standard questions to measure the level of anxiety among the workers.

(c) Productivity: Since the workers are paid at piece-rates, we will be able to measure individual productivity or efficiency. The Foundation uses standard minute values to set the piece-rates and assigns jobs to different workers (as suggested in the initial meetings with them). We will work closely with the Foundation to measure efficiency as rigorously as possible.

(d) Labor Market Participation: We will measure (using both surveys and administrative data), the number of days and hours worked before and after the introduction of the interventions. We will measure the pieces that the artisans turn in and also compensation received as such. Data will also be collected on time spent on other activities to capture the total effect of the interventions.","","We will use the sub-centres as units of intervention and the artisans (and their households) as units of observation. We will use a cluster randomized control trial to identify the effects of introducing a health security scheme to the female artisans employed by the Ayesha Abed Foundation. Each sub-centre will constitute a cluster (with 20-25 artisans). The project will use a mixed-method strategy with specific focus on quantitatively assessing the impact of the scheme on health and labour market outcomes (such as salaries absenteeism, and productivity). In partnership with the Foundation, the research team will randomly choose 25 sub-centres from 50 pre-specified sub-centres for interventions. We will assess all relevant outcomes and possibly causally associate them with the intervention by comparing artisans between control and treatment sub-centres. We will measure the intent-to-treat effects for all the outcomes of interest using the following econometric specification:

y(ikt)= αD(k) + βT(t) + γ[D(k)*T(t)] + δX(ikt) + ε(ikt)

where, D(k)=1 if the k-th sub-center received the treatment and 0 otherwise. Similarly, T(t)=1 if the observation is made after the intervention is introduced and 0 otherwise. Hence, the coefficient γ will measure the impact of the program as by design of random assignment, D(k)⊥ε(ikt). Since the intervention will be introduced at the sub-centre level (specified as k), we will adjust the standard errors by clustering at the sub-centre level. In the previous equation, X(ikt) are other observable covariates (measured at the baseline) which would help us enhance the precision of the treatment effect estimates.","",Fifty sub-centers (small clusters of production units with 20-30 workers per unit) will be selected by the implementation partner.

With an intra-cluster correlation of 5 per cent and average number of artisans per cluster (sub-centre) of 25, we get the required number of clusters of 50 in total (25 sub-centres in control and 25 in treatment group) to ensure the required statistical power to identify the impact of the program with sufficient precision."

","The study is carried out in collaboration with the Indian NGO Basix Sub-k. It builds on the recent expansion of the business correspondent model (BCM) in India. In collaboration with formal banks, Basix Sub-k is opening bank accounts in different States over the country. In rural areas, the NGO selects one villager to become the local banker (the business correspondent sub agent or BCSA). He receives training, a receipt machine, a finger print recognition device and a mobile phone connected through the mobile network to the partner bank. The BCSA can then use those devices to perform standard transactions on their accounts: deposits, withdrawals and transfers.
In villages where Basix Sub-k has recently opened BCSA accounts, we do weekly interviews during 7 to 13 weeks, to gather detailed information about the evolution of their household composition and the various earnings and expenditures of their household members. Because those surveys are extremely demanding, each participant is offered Rs150 after each interview.
Phase 1
To test the above hypotheses we designed the study as follows. We operate in an area with recent BCSAs. We select a random sample of people who opened an account (group A) and a random sample of people who did not. That second sample (of people without account) is subject to the first treatment: we give an account to two third of them. After this first treatment, we are left with three groups: A – already had an account, B – received a new account, and C – did not have an account and is not offered one. 
The second treatment in the experiment is a randomization of the way the weekly compensation is paid. Half of the respondents with a BCSA account receive Rs150 directly on their account (treated), while the others receive it in cash (control). 
We now have 5 different groups: Ac had an account and is paid cash, Aa had an account and is paid on it, Bc just received an account and is paid cash, Ba just received an account and is paid on it, C does not have an account and is paid cash. The comparison between these five groups will provide clear information on the impacts of the different steps of the financial inclusion process. 
The first randomization, providing bank accounts to people who initially did not self-select into the new banking system, has two main goals:
-	Measuring the first step of the process: having a bank account versus not having one
-	Evaluating the importance of the initial self-selection. Existing studies suffer from the caveat that they only observe impacts on the pool of self-selected individuals (corresponding to our group A). Those impacts may not be representative of what a large scale financial inclusion plan (with accounts opened for everyone) would achieve.  

The second randomization (cash versus account) aims at measuring the second step of the financial inclusion process: going from having a bank account but receiving cash payments, to having a bank account and being paid on that account. Importantly, given that (i) all respondents have an account (in groups A and B); (ii) there is no direct cost in depositing or withdrawing; (iii) all respondents in a village receive their compensation at the same location, close to the BCSA; we can attribute the treatment effect to the ‘default option’ described above.

Phase 2
One month after the last week of interviews of phase 1, we will re-start the weekly surveys for an additional period of four weeks. During these weeks, we will compensate everyone in cash as to test whether the initial treatments have impacts that last in the medium term. ","

The program will be implemented as a randomized control trial (RCT) beginning in December 2015 and will provide cash transfers to eligible poor households for three years.  Households will be eligible for a conditional cash transfer if they have primary school aged children and eligible for an unconditional cash transfer if they have children who are not yet eligible to enroll in primary school. Additionally the program incorporates a “Mother Leader” (ML) component, in which beneficiaries democratically elect a group member to lead monthly health, child development and citizenship training sessions. Behaviorally-informed nudges are designed to enhance the effects of the program. The program is designed as a multi-level RCT with the cash transfer being randomized at an aggregate level, the commune (third-level administrative divisions of Madagascar), and the ML and nudges being randomized at a lower level of the village unit, the fokontany. We seek to measure effects of the treatments on household economic well-being, child health and educational outcomes, and anthropometric measures.",2015-12-01,2019-04-23,"Key outcome variables to measure include the following:

+ Food-related household consumption and spending 
+ Non-food household consumption and spending 
+ Household agricultural production
+ Household income sources
+ The role of women / female empowerment
+ Parental interactions with children
+ Household food security
+ Savings behaviors
+ Child health
+ Child school attendance and educational outcomes
+ Cognitive development of children
+ Adult psychological well-being","","Subjects 
The subjects in this experiment were individuals in poor rural regions of Madagascar that have children between the ages of 0 and 10 years AND have been deemed as among the lowest income individuals in the community. 

Study Design 
The impact evaluation will randomly sample a balanced number of beneficiaries from across the control regions and the various program groups outlined below. A survey will be conducted on the random sample to capture outcome measures on the variables listed above.

HDCT Program Groups 
Subjects were randomized into six groups, namely: 

0. Control (No cash transfer)
1. Cash Transfer
2. Cash Transfer + Mother Leader
3. Cash Transfer + Mother Leader + Nudge 1
4. Cash Transfer + Mother Leader + Nudge 2
5. Cash Transfer + Mother Leader + Nudge 1 + Nudge 2

Cash Transfer
The monetary transfer is the basis for the HDCT program. A cash transfer is disbursed to program beneficiaries on a bi-monthly basis. A base amount is given to all beneficiary families, with additional amounts allocated for each of up to two children. For families with children who are eligible for primary school based on their age (6-10 years old), the transfer amount is conditional on the child having at least an 80% school attendance record. For families with children who have not yet reached primary school age, the transfer is unconditional. 

Mother Leader Program
Borrowing from an expansive literature on the efficacy of community-based health promotion workers and building upon the recent experience of empowering beneficiary women in a cash transfer project in Colombia, the HDCT program includes a “Mother Leader” (ML) component. Beneficiary women are assigned to small groups within their fokontany and each group elected one of the group members to serve as a Mother Leader for a term of one year, a voluntary position. MLs are trained in child development activities, health promotion activities, and civics, lessons that they then impart in monthly group sessions. MLs also act as a liaison between the program administrators and the beneficiaries. The ML program also includes group-wide activities related to savings, community participation, or financial empowerment activities.

Behaviorally-Informed Nudges
Behaviorally-informed nudges will be implemented at the ML group level and will be designed to enhance the effects of the mother leader and cash transfer program treatment interventions.

Between June 2011 and January 2013, GiveDirectly distributed unconditional cash transfers to 500 poor rural households. The transfers were sent to recipients' mobile phones using the M-Pesa technology. The present RCT includes three treatments: first, the transfers were randomly chosen to be sent to either the primary female or the primary male member of the household. Second, the transfers were randomly assigned to be sent as either a large lump-sum payment, or a series of nine monthly installments of the same total amount. Third, the magnitude of the total transfer to each treatment household was randomly chosen to be either $300 or $1,100.

Our main questions are: (i) What are the overall impacts of UCTs on various dimensions of household welfare? (ii) How should UCTs be structured to maximize impact? In particular, how do outcomes vary with three key, yet understudied, design parameters: recipient gender, transfer frequency, and transfer size? The intervention therefore contains the following treatment arms: 

1. Transfers to the woman vs. the man in the household. First, half of the transfers were made to the woman, while the other half were made to the man. This feature allows us to identify the differential welfare effects of gender-specific cash transfers. 

2. Lump-sum transfers vs. monthly installments. Second, half of the transfers were lump sum, and the other half was paid in 9 monthly installments. By randomizing the month in which the lump sum transfer was made, we kept the discounted present value of the lump-sum and installment transfers similar across the overall lump sum and monthly installment groups.

3. Large vs. small transfers. Finally, a proportion (28%) of the transfers were $1,100 in magnitude, while the remainder were $300. This manipulation allows us to estimate the effect of transfer magnitude on welfare outcomes. 

These three treatment arms are fully crossed with each other, except that the $1,100 transfers were made to existing recipients of $300 transfers in the form of a $800 top-up that was delivered as a stream of payments after respondents had already been told that they would receive $300 transfers. The pre-analysis plan outlines how this issue is dealt with in the analysis. 

Evaluation Design 

Sampling and Identification strategy 

To establish a causal relationship between the program and changes in outcomes, this study uses a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). We first identified Rarieda as an intervention area because it has (i) high poverty rates according to census data, and (ii) sufficient M-Pesa access to make transfers feasible. We then identified 100 villages based on the overall prevalence of eligible households in the village. In these villages, we identified 1,500 eligible households, with eligibility determined by residing in a home made of mud, grass, and other non-solid materials. These criteria are simple, objective, and transparent, maximizing accountability. The criteria were not pre-announced to avoid “gaming” of the eligibility rules. We then randomized on two levels -- across villages, and within villages. Specifically, 50 villages were randomly assigned to be treatment villages, while the other 50 were pure control villages. In each of the latter, we surveyed 10 households that did not receive a cash transfer. Within treatment villages, we conducted a within-village randomization: 50% of eligible households were randomly assigned a cash transfer; the other 50% received no transfer (GD will seek to make transfers to this group after the study). This strategy allows us to identify spillover effects (detailed in the pre-analysis plan). 

Spillover effects 

We use three approaches to quantify spillover effects. First, we used pure control villages to quantify within-village spillovers. Comparing control households in treatment villages to those in pure control villages identifies within-village spillover effects. Second, we identify spillover effects across villages. Note that these effects could potentially be even more pronounced than within villages, if, for instance, entire villages are affected by weather shocks. Using GPS data on village location, we can identify cross-village spillovers, under the assumption that these spillovers are geographically correlated. Third, a separate village-level survey elicited general equilibrium effects of the intervention at the level of the local economy; we surveyed residents of the village on prices, labor supply, wages, crime, investment, community relations (e.g. perceived fairness of targeting criteria) and power dynamics. 

Data collection methods and instruments 

Data was collected at baseline and one year after the intervention. A midline with a subset of questions was administered to a sample of respondents each month after the intervention. Trained interviewers visited the households; both the primary male and the primary female of the household were interviewed (separately). Surveys were administered on Netbooks using the Blaise survey software. Following standard IPA procedure, we performed backchecks consisting of 10% of the survey, with a focus on non-changing information, on 10% of all interviews. This procedure was known to field officers ex ante. Saliva samples were collected using the Salivette (Sarstedt, Germany), which has been used extensively in psychological and medical research, and more recently in randomized trials in developing countries similar to this one. It requires the respondent to chew on a sterile cellulose swab, which is then centrifuged and analyzed for salivary cortisol. 

Power calculation 

The sample size of 500 individuals in each of the treatment, control, and pure control conditions was chosen based on a power calculation, which showed that a sample of 1,000 individuals is sufficient to detect effect sizes of 0.2 SD for all treatment vs. pure control households with 89% power. Different treatment arms within the treatment groups (male vs. female recipient, lump-sum vs. monthly, large vs. small transfers) can be compared with 60% power. 

Risk and treatment of attrition 

Attrition was not a significant concern in this study because it became evident early on in GD’s work in Kenya that respondents were highly interested in maintaining relations with GiveDirectly in the hope of receiving future transfers (although these are never promised). Nevertheless, we used five approaches to control attrition. First, the survey contained a detailed tracking module developed by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the NGO implementing the fieldwork. IPA and GD collaborated closely throughout the study to facilitate tracking. Second, we incentivized survey completion through a small appreciation gift (a jar of cooking fat); in addition, respondents earned money from the economic games in the survey. Third, in our power calculations, an attrition rate of 20% would still result in a power of 80%. In fact, we only observed 3% attrition between the two visits of the baseline. Finally, we control for attrition econometrically in the analysis, as detailed in the pre-analysis plan.","",Computerized randomization in office.,household (treatment vs. spillover households) and village (treatment/spillover vs. pure control villages),100 villages,1500 households,"500 households treatment, 500 households spillover, 500 households pure control","0.2 SD, 89%"
The Effectiveness of Business Coaching on Technology-Based Ventures' Survival Capabilities,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/973,"December 08, 2015",2015-12-08 05:15:00 -0500,AEARCTR-0000973,"Christina Ungerer, cungerer@htwg-konstanz.de",on_going,2015-03-23,2018-01-01,"[""education"", ""finance"", ""governance"", """"]","","In order to enable offering more effective business coaching activities in the future, this research program analyzes the impact of such coaching on venture survival capabilities. The entrepreneurship research initiative, conducted by the Institute for Strategic Innovation & Technology (IST) at the Constance University of Applied Sciences, Germany, is supported by Nesta with an Innovation Growth Lab grant.

Technology-based ventures foster economic growth by accelerating the transfer of new technological knowledge to the market. Regional innovation activity is stimulated by expanding the technology-based venture eco-system. As a consequence, the industrial landscape is modernized and additional jobs are created. Hence, the public sector is interested in increasing technology-based ventures’ survival prospects by effectively allocating limited financial resources to support them. 

Business coaching is an important support measure that positively impacts venture team performance because it helps to address the challenges of high-speed organizational change which founders face. Though not much research has investigated this type of supportive intervention applied to technology-oriented startups, it is a key value proposition provided by incubation and acceleration programs. But how do we know that business coaching actually affects survival capabilities, and thus the growth of ventures?

Following the conceptual design of a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study, this research program applies quantitative research methods in a business context to investigate the cause-and-effect-relationship between business coaching and venture survival. RCTs represent a specific experimental study design, achieving the highest hierarchy of evidence in primary research. RCT studies first appeared in the fields of psychology and medicine to test the effectiveness of treatments on patients. Within business contexts, the method has hardly been applied yet – though it is seen as the gold standard for analyzing the effectiveness of an observed intervention.

For the RCT study, a longitudinal sample of 450 early-stage, technology-based ventures will be recruited in Germany over three years (2015-2017) by the project delivery partner bwcon GmbH. bwcon is an expert in supporting technology-based ventures and will selectively offer business coaching to the sampled ventures following the defined RCT experiment design. Six months post-intervention, the survival capabilities of those ventures which received coaching are compared with those which did not receive the support intervention. Survival capabilities will be measured based on indicators for the maturity of the ventures’ value-networks in various market dimensions. It is expected that the survival capabilities significantly differ between the two groups, thus proving the effectiveness of business coaching.

Accordingly, by using the unique database of early-stage, technology-based ventures from the German regional state Baden-Württemberg, a deeper understanding of the impact of coaching activities will be gained. Identifying underlying causal effects of the effectiveness of business coaching on venture survival capabilities enables accelerators and entrepreneurship program providers to become more effective, which accelerates startup business growth in the long-run.
",2015-03-23,2017-09-01,"The primary outcome of interest to the research team is venture survival capability. In conformity with the main research goal and the primary research question, the effectiveness of tactical business coaching in increasing survival capabilities of newly founded businesses is detected.","Measuring the absolute rate of survival entails the challenge of limited comparing opportunities due to the fact that the sample is drawn over time. A more refined measurement of survival thus was introduced by breaking down the outcome measure ‘survival’ into survival capability classes. Based on network theory and the assumption that the likelihood of survival increases as the venture’s value-network of transactions with partners in various dimensions (selling, procurement, HR, and capital markets) matures, we are measuring five distinct survival capability classes in these four categories summing up to a total survival capability score.","A pragmatic two-armed Randomized Controlled Trial represents the basic study design testing the effect of tactical knowledge coaching on the survival capabilities of technology-based early-stage ventures. Over three years, 450 ventures from the German regional state Baden-Württemberg will be recruited.Accredited, experienced coaches are imparting certain tactical knowledge to the founder teams in the form of individual support sessions. The treatment group (T) encompasses 150 startups in total, each year about 50 being subject to the intervention. Not having been coached with a focus on tactical knowledge, another 300 ventures serve as the control group (C). After three years, ventures' survival capability (total score) six months post-intervention is compared.","The RCT sample will be gained over time from a new venture support program introduced by our delivery partner bwcon GmbH. Based on past experience, at least about 150 ventures are recruited per year, creating a total sample size of N=450 after three years. Budget restrictions limit the number of ventures being subject to the intensive support program focusing on imparting and developing tactical business knowledge (treatment group) to 50 per year, which sums up to N=150 (T) after three years. The control group is N=300 (C) accordingly.

Structured data will be gathered via the bwcon Venture Development Platform, an online database allowing venture teams to submit and work on their business plan, simultaneously documenting coaching interventions and development. Evaluations by experts on the basis of an index comprise the primary outcome measure items as explained in section seven.  Additional information will be gathered by making use of questionnaires, directly asking founder teams to update their data at regular intervals. Currently planned are half-yearly updates via the Venture Development System platform starting post-intervention. These data include ventures’ growth indicators such as revenue, employees, and capital acquired which are used for analyzing the secondary research questions.","Restricted blocked randomization will be used to ensure the budget-limited number of interventions (50/year) is entirely reached. One ‘block’ in this specific context refers to a one-year budget of 50 coaching contracts, randonly allocated to venture teams by bwcon consultants.
",Randomization is done on a venture team level.,450 venture teams,450 venture teams,"In this business coaching RCT, 150 venture teams are subject to the intervention, while 300 are in the control group.","The trial design provides adequate statistical power. In a very conservative setting assuming an unrealistically high pooled standard deviation (4.2) drawn from an extreme-outcome pre-sample, a two-sided t-test, α=0.05, and power against alternative hypothesis = 0.8, results suggest that the minimum required sample size to detect an effect size of 0.2 (comparison of groups 6 months after the intervention) is 321, meaning 107 for the treatment group and 214 for the control group. Given a sample size of 360 (conservative estimation of sample size reached at the time the final analysis for the RCT is planned) and an allocation ratio of ventures receiving tactical coaching to those of the control group of 1:2, the minimum detectable effect size (MDES) is 0.18."
