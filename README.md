Use Scrapy to scrape the RCT Registry

This repository contains the python scripts to scrape the [AEA RCT Registry](http://www.socialscienceregistry.org). Any time you want to do this
you can easily get the list of URLs by submitting an empty search, which produces a .csv file with the URLs and several, but perhaps not all of the other fields
you might want.

I'm not really an expert at scraping, I owe most of this to Andrew Suciu of Stanford's Code the Change.
