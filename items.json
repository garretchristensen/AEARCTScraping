EPIICA is piloting the sale of WII tied with short-term production credit. To that end, a baseline survey was conducted in early 2011 in 120 rural Kebeles (villages or farmer associations) in four zones of the Amhara region in Ethiopia . The choice of the Kebeles was non-random but instead was designed on the basis of informed opinion of NISCO as to where in the Amhara region the market for WII has best potential. Households within the selected kebeles were randomly sampled to participate in the study; in each village 18 cooperative households and 2 households that are not a member of the primary cooperative were selected.  Because fertilizers are procured exclusively through primary cooperatives and their upper level zonal Cooperative Unions (CUs) in Ethiopia, it is anticipated that cooperative households may display a higher propensity to uptake additional fertilizer if risk concerns can be ameliorated.   \r", "\r", "The core of the project is a rainfall index insurance product pioneered by Nyala Insurance Company.  This product is based on rainfall as measured at 8 different rainfall stations in Amhara, operated by the National Meteorological Agency (NMA).  Farmers could purchase insurance prior to the planting season for a specified crop and quantity of land, and for an amount up to the total cost of inputs for the size of land planted to a given crop. For each crop and location an index has been designed based on local meteorological conditions and crop water requirements that predicts partial or total crop failure based on realized rainfall measurements.  If the index indicates a partial crop failure, the insurance makes a partial payout.  If the index indicates total crop failure, the insurance will make a full payout.  The intent is that farmers are insuring the cost of their inputs (not the total value of the harvest), and so the payouts are designed to reimburse farmers for lost input investments, and thereby enable them to take more risk in the use of fertilizers and improved seeds.  If the farmers take a loan to purchase the inputs, then the insurance basically acts as collateral, for default that can be caused by weather events as seen in the index, to the Bank for the amount lent.  \r", "\r", "The EPIICA study is a state-of-the art scientific pilot, which, after having designed the relevant weather indices and loan products, implements a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to generate an experimental control group and thereby to measure the impact of the program on farm productivity and household welfare, as well as the institutional profitability of Nyala and Dashen.  The study is a two-armed trial, comparing two distinct ways of implementing weather insurance.  The first of them, the Standalone product, offers only an index insurance product to farmers in 17 kebele cooperatives.  Here, farmers can purchase insurance (although the costs of the insurance premiums may be financed by the cooperatives in some cases) and receive payouts if inadequate rainfall is measured at the nearest rainfall station. The second is the Interlinked product, in which the project provides insured credit to cooperative farmers in 17 additional kebeles.  For the Interlinked product, farmers will first purchase insurance from Nyala, and are then eligible to access credit from Dashen Bank for an amount up to the sum insured by the index product.  On Interlinked loans the insurance contract is written over to Dashen as a form of collateral - for default that can be caused by weather events as seen in the index.Dashen Bank has accepted to use this type of insurance contract as an innovative form of partial collateral in this pilot. If the weather is good, and hence the rainfall index does not trigger insurance payments, the farmers must repay this loan plus interest.  If the weather is bad, then the loan will be partially or completely forgiven based on the insurance payout that will be made directly from Nyala to Dashen\r"], "irb_name": ["UCSD Human Research Protections Program"], "rct_id": ["AEARCTR-0000451"], "irb_number": ["101578"]},

The intervention is of the following nature: Whenever a sewing line in the factory starts producing a new garment that it had not produced before but that was already produced on another sewing line, than the supervisor of the line that already produced the garment is actively involved in setting up the new line for producing the same garment. Sewing lines in our Bangladeshi partner factories typically switch the garment they produce every 1-3 weeks, and it is very common to see garments being produced on more than one line, while usually starting on different days. Switching the garment typically requires both changes of the machines used and/or adjustments on the machines themselves, such as change of the needle type or yarn type. The workers on the lines also need to be explained the new operations they have to perform on the new garment.

This lottery provides an opportunity to gauge the effects of expanding access to public health insurance on the health care use, financial strain, and health of low-income adults using a randomized controlled design. In the year after random assignment, the treatment group selected by the lottery was about 25 percentage points more likely to have insurance than the control group that was not selected. We find that in this first year, the treatment group had substantively and statistically significantly higher health care utilization (including primary and preventive care as well as hospitalizations), lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical debt (including fewer bills sent to collection), and better self-reported physical and mental health than the control group.", "Despite imminent expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, the effects of expanding coverage are unclear. Oregon\u2019s 2008 Medicaid expansion using lottery drawings from a waiting list provides an opportunity to evaluate the effects of Medicaid using random assignment. Approximately two years after the lottery, we collected data from 6,387 adults randomly selected to be able to apply for Medicaid coverage and 5,842 not selected. Measures included blood pressure, cholesterol and glycosylated hemoglobin; a depression screen; medication catalogs; and self-reported diagnoses, health, health care utilization and out-of-pocket spending. We use the lottery\u2019s random assignment to calculate the effect of Medicaid coverage.We found no statistically significant effect of Medicaid on the prevalence, diagnosis, or medication of hypertension or high cholesterol. Medicaid coverage significantly increased the diagnosis of diabetes and use of diabetes medication, but we observed no significant effect on average glycosylated hemoglobin levels nor on the percent with levels >6.5%. Medicaid coverage decreased the probability of screening positive for depression (-9.15 percentage points; 95% CI: -16.70 to -1.60; P=0.018), increased use of preventive services, and almost eliminated catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures. Thus, evidence using a randomized controlled design showed that Medicaid coverage generated no statistically significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first two years, but did generate increased health care use, higher rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and lower financial strain.", "In 2008, a group of uninsured low-income adults in Oregon was selected by lottery for the chance to apply for Medicaid. We use this randomized design and 2009 administrative data to evaluate the effect of Medicaid on labor market outcomes and participation in other social safety net programs. We find no significant effect of Medicaid on employment or earnings: our 95 percent confidence intervals allow us to reject that Medicaid causes a decline in employment of more than 4.4 percentage points, or an increase of more than 1.2 percentage points. We find that Medicaid increases receipt of food stamps, but has little, if any, impact on receipt of other government benefits, including SSDI.", "In 2008, Oregon initiated a limited expansion of a Medicaid program for uninsured, low-income adults, drawing names from a waiting list by lottery. This lottery created a rare opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage using a randomized controlled design. Using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency department records from Portland-area hospitals, we study the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over approximately 18 months after the lottery. We find that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40 percent relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group.

Three years after farmers received training, training did not increase household income or consumption. Training also did not affect mediating outcomes, such as adoption of agricultural practices or changes in cultivation of crops, which suggests that longer-term impacts are unlikely to materialize. Many farmers lacked the financial means to invest in the types of practices that were the focus of the curricula, and farmers were also often unwilling to try new crops that have higher up-front costs even if they are much more profitable in the long run. Our findings highlight the challenges that even a well-implemented training program has in spurring behavioral change among farmers and the challenges of providing effective services when foreign aid agencies prioritize having a large programmatic footprint.
